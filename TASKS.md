# Hybrid "Recent Changes" Feature Implementation

This task list tracks the implementation of a "Recent Changes" feature using the core `effect` package for managing effects and data handling.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Initial task planning and organization
- [x] Define `RecentChangesProps` interface in `quartz/components/RecentChanges.tsx`
- [x] Create the basic functional component structure for `RecentChanges` in `quartz/components/RecentChanges.tsx`
- [x] Implement data fetching logic using `Effect` from the core `effect` package to retrieve and sort recent changes.
- [x] Implement component rendering logic to display fetched data (title, date, link).
- [x] Add styling for the component in both condensed and detailed views (`quartz/styles/custom.scss`)
- [x] Create the dedicated page markdown file (`content/recent-changes.md`)
- [x] Implement human-readable date formatting (e.g., "2 days ago")
- [x] Implement differentiation between 'new' and 'updated' items visually
- [x] Refactor `RecentChanges.tsx`: Extract data processing logic to `utils/recentChanges.ts`.

## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] Integrate the `RecentChanges` component into the homepage layout (`quartz.layout.ts`) with a condensed view (e.g., limit=5)
- [ ] Add the `RecentChanges` component to the `content/recent-changes.md` page layout with a detailed view
- [ ] Update sidebar navigation in `quartz.layout.ts` to include a link to `/recent-changes`

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Implement filtering options on the dedicated page (e.g., by domain, type of change - new/updated)
- [ ] Implement pagination for the list on the dedicated page
- [ ] Implement caching strategy for the fetched data using `Cache` from the core `effect` package.
- [ ] Add visual indicators for very recent changes (e.g., within the last 24 hours) in the sidebar or on the page
- [ ] Ensure proper semantic HTML markup and ARIA attributes for accessibility
- [ ] Test component behavior with various configurations (limit, detailed, showCreated/Updated)
- [ ] Test component with edge cases (no content, large amounts of content, fetching errors handled by `Effect`)
- [ ] Test page responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility
- [ ] Document the `RecentChanges` component's props and usage
- [ ] Add a section about the feature to the project README or documentation

## Implementation Plan

The Recent Changes feature has been implemented as a reusable component leveraging the core `effect` package for robust, declarative, and type-safe handling of asynchronous operations, data transformations, and potential errors.

### Component Design
- Created a configurable component `RecentChanges.tsx` using TypeScript and functional component patterns.
- Defined a clear `RecentChangesProps` interface.
- Component displays recently created and updated notes with metadata (title, date, link).
- Supports differentiation between new and updated content.

### Data Fetching and Processing
- Utilized Quartz's content index/file system APIs to get file metadata.
- Wrapped data retrieval in `Effect` computations (e.g., `Effect.try`).
- Used `Effect` combinators for data transformation and sorting.
- Ready to implement `Cache` from the `effect` package for efficient data caching.
- Handled potential errors gracefully.

### Placement Strategy
1.  **Homepage Integration**: Plan to add condensed view (3-5 items, title/date), with link to full page.
2.  **Dedicated Page (`/recent-changes`)**: Ready to add comprehensive view, detailed info, filtering, pagination.
3.  **Sidebar Navigation**: Will add link to the dedicated page, with visual indicator for new changes.

### Technical Implementation

The component has been implemented with the following features:
- Retrieving and processing file metadata (creation/modification dates)
- Filtering items by type and category
- Human-readable date formatting
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Demo mode for easy testing

### Next Steps

1. Update `quartz.layout.ts` to integrate the component on the homepage and dedicated page
2. Add pagination and filtering to the dedicated page
3. Implement the full caching strategy using `Cache` from `effect`
4. Finalize real data fetching and demo mode toggle

### Relevant Files

- `quartz/components/RecentChanges.tsx` - Main component (using core `effect` package)
- `quartz.layout.ts` - Layout configuration (to be updated for homepage & sidebar)
- `content/recent-changes.md` - Dedicated page (created)
- `quartz/styles/custom.scss` - Styling updates (added)
- `quartz.config.ts` - Potentially needed for accessing file data or configuring caching

## Refactoring & Code Quality
- [x] Refactor `mainMenu.inline.ts` using Effect-TS.
    - [x] Address TypeScript lint errors.
- [x] Refactor `RecentChanges.tsx`: Extract data processing logic to `utils/recentChanges.ts`.
- [ ] Implement unit tests for Effect-TS logic in `mainMenu.inline.ts`.
- [ ] Consider unit tests for `utils/recentChanges.ts`.
- [ ] Review Effect-TS usage for potential optimizations or simplification.

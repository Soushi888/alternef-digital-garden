# Project Overview: Alternef Digital Garden

## 1. Introduction

Alternef Digital Garden is a personal knowledge management system (PKMS) built using Quartz v4. It serves as an interconnected knowledge ecosystem, designed as a personal wiki and knowledge sharing platform. The goal is to create a dynamic and evolving space for exploring, connecting, and sharing insights across various domains of knowledge.

## 2. Goals

-   **Create a Centralized Knowledge Hub:** Consolidate personal notes, research, and insights into a single, searchable platform.
-   **Foster Interconnected Thinking:** Utilize backlinks and graph visualization to reveal relationships between concepts.
-   **Share Knowledge:** Make curated knowledge publicly accessible via GitHub Pages.
-   **Experiment with Digital Gardening:** Explore best practices for cultivating a living knowledge base.
-   **Build a Resilient System:** Use robust, open-source tools (Quartz, Markdown, Git).

## 3. Scope

-   **Content:** Focus on 7 core knowledge domains (Land Stewardship, Built Environment, Tools/Tech, Culture/Education, Health/Wellbeing, Finance/Economics, Governance/Community). Includes notes, indexes, blog posts, and portfolio items.
-   **Features:** Based on Quartz v4 functionality (Markdown rendering, wikilinks, backlinks, graph view, tagging, search, themes).
-   **Technology:** Quartz v4, TypeScript, Markdown, SCSS, npm/Bun, Git, GitHub Pages.
-   **Audience:** Primarily personal use, but publicly accessible for others interested in the topics.

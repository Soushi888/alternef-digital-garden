## Content Types

### Notes
- Core knowledge units
- Focused on a single concept or idea
- Heavily linked to related concepts
- Located in domain-specific directories

### Indexes
- Provide overview and navigation for a domain or subdomain
- List key concepts and relationships
- Serve as entry points to knowledge areas
- Named `index.md` within their respective directories

### Blog Posts
- Date-based content
- More narrative and personal
- Can cross-reference notes
- Located in the `blog` directory

### Portfolio Items
- Project showcases
- Case studies
- Demonstrations of applied knowledge
- Located in the `portfolio` directory

## Interconnection Guidelines

- Each note should link to at least 3 related notes
- Domain indexes should link to key concepts and sub-domains
- Cross-domain connections should be highlighted
- Use "related pages" in frontmatter to make connections explicit
- Consider creating "bridge notes" that connect concepts across domains

## Content Evolution

- Notes should evolve over time
- Update existing notes rather than creating duplicates
- Add new connections as the garden grows
- Refactor and reorganize periodically
- Split overly complex notes into multiple interconnected notes

## Navigation Principles

- Provide multiple paths to discover content
- Use consistent navigation patterns
- Ensure no content is orphaned (unlinked)
- Create thematic entry points
- Balance depth and breadth in content organization

   - Comprehensive tags: tools-and-technology, networking, wireless, mobile, cellular, tethering, internet-sharing
   - Added standard metadata (created, modified, draft: false)

2. **meshstastic.md**
   - Added title: "Meshtastic"
   - Enhanced aliases: ["Meshtastic Network", "Off-grid Mesh", "Decentralized Communication", "LoRa Mesh Network"]
   - Comprehensive tags: tools-and-technology, networking, mesh-network, off-grid, decentralized, lora, open-source, communication
   - Added standard metadata (created, modified, draft: false)

3. **ism-radio-band.md**
   - Added title: "ISM Radio Bands"
   - Enhanced aliases: ["Industrial Scientific Medical Bands", "ISM Frequencies", "ISM Spectrum", "Radio Spectrum ISM"]
   - Comprehensive tags: tools-and-technology, networking, radio-frequency, wireless, spectrum-regulation, industrial, scientific, medical
   - Added standard metadata (created, modified, draft: false)

## Summary
All networking files in the digital garden now have complete, standardized frontmatter following the established template:

```yaml
---
title: "Proper Title Format"
aliases: ["Alternative Name", "Common Acronym", "Related Term"]
tags: [tools-and-technology, networking, specific-tags]
created: 2025-12-02
modified: 2025-12-02
draft: false
---
```

Total networking files standardized: 18+ files across the entire networking section, ensuring consistent metadata quality and enhanced discoverability.

- **Place-based**: Connected to bioregional and circular economy concepts

## Content Strategy Insights

### Domain Classification Decisions
- **Primary Domain**: Governance and Community (organizational focus)
- **Secondary Domain**: Finance and Economics (alternative economic models)
- **Tertiary Domain**: Tools and Technology (technical implementation)

### Link Pattern Successes
- **Pipe syntax wikilinks**: Used consistently for clean display: [[target|Display Text]]
- **Bidirectional linking**: Created strong connections between OVN theory and Sensorica practice
- **Multi-domain presence**: Content appears across multiple relevant indices
- **Hierarchical linking**: Connected abstract concepts to concrete examples

### Content Structure Patterns
- **Comprehensive frontmatter**: Title, description, aliases, tags, dates
- **Hierarchical organization**: Clear sections with logical progression
- **Practical examples**: Real-world applications and case studies
- **Resource sections**: External links and further reading

## Technical Implementation Notes

### File Organization
- **Standardized naming**: kebab-case filenames following Quartz conventions
- **Proper path structure**: `content/knowledge/domain/topic.md`
- **Frontmatter compliance**: YAML headers with complete metadata
- **Content validation**: Quartz build successful with no errors

### Link Implementation
- **Absolute paths for index links**: `[[knowledge/domain/index|Display]]`
- **Relative links for same-domain content**: `[[topic-name|Display]]`
- **Section linking**: `[[file#section|Display]]` format for specific references
- **External links**: Standard Markdown format with proper URLs

## Discoveries and Learnings

### Content Creation Efficiency
- **Research integration**: WebFetch tool effective for gathering current information
- **Pattern recognition**: Existing content structure provided clear templates

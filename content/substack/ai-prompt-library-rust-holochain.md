## üí° Tips for Maximum Effectiveness

### Context is King
Always provide relevant context: your app type, current code, specific goals, and constraints. The more context you give, the more targeted and useful the AI's response will be.

### Iterate and Refine
Don't accept the first answer. Ask follow-up questions like:
- "Can you explain that differently?"
- "What are the trade-offs with this approach?"
- "How would this work in a real-world scenario?"

### Combine Prompts
Use multiple prompts together. Start with understanding, move to implementation, then ask for review and optimization.

### Save Your Variations
As you use these prompts, modify them to fit your specific needs and save the variations that work best for your learning style.

### Validate Everything
Always review AI-generated code and suggestions. Use them as starting points, not final solutions.

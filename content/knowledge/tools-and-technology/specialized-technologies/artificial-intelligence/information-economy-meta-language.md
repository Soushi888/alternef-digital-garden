**IEML** (Information Economy Meta-Language) is an open-source artificial metalanguage designed to represent the semantic content of linguistic signs in a computer-readable way. It was developed by **Pierre Lévy** as part of his work on **collective intelligence**, aiming to encode meaning in a way that is both computable and aligned with the expressive power of natural languages.

## About Pierre Lévy

Pierre Lévy is a philosopher and pioneer in the study of the impact of the Internet on human knowledge and culture. His seminal work *Collective Intelligence: Mankind's Emerging World in Cyberspace* (French 1994, English 1999) described a kind of collective intelligence that extends everywhere and is constantly evaluated and coordinated in real time—a collective human intelligence augmented by new information technologies.

- **Canada Research Chair in Collective Intelligence** at the University of Ottawa (2002-2016), where IEML was developed with over $1 million in federal funding
- **Adjunct Professor** at the Literature and World Languages Department, Université de Montréal
- **Co-founder and CEO** of INTLEKT Metadata Inc.
- **Fellow** of the Royal Society of Canada

Lévy's research focuses on reconciling [[knowledge/tools-and-technology/specialized-technologies/artificial-intelligence/index|artificial intelligence]] with collective intelligence, and exploring the intersections between philosophy, science, religion, and technology.

## Philosophical Context

IEML can be understood as a modern realization of historical ambitions in symbolic logic and language:

- **Ramon Llull's Ars Magna**: The medieval combinatorial system that inspired computational approaches to knowledge
- **Leibniz's Characteristica Universalis**: The dream of a universal symbolic language that could express all human thought and enable logical reasoning through calculation

While IEML is not a complete *calculus ratiocinator* (it does not possess a true "alphabet of thought") or a philosophical language per se, it builds on these foundations using modern understanding of computer semantics and philosophy of language.

## Core Concept

The goal of IEML is to make real-world data machine-readable by proposing a standard representation that enables the mapping of semantic representations with data in a computer-friendly manner.

IEML's design starts with a small set of **primary concepts (semantic primitives)** arranged in a matrix, which are composed together to create more complex concepts. This process repeats recursively, allowing increasingly complex concepts to emerge through a **fractal, matrix-based design**. This architecture makes representations:
- Easy to manipulate
- Quick to calculate semantic distances between concepts
- Simple to encode

## Unique Properties

As of 2021, IEML is the only metalanguage that combines all of the following properties:

1. **Fully Regular Grammar**: A completely regular and recursive grammar with approximately 3,000 dictionary words organized in paradigms (systems of substitution)
2. **Self-Defining**: With each concept automatically determined by composition and substitution relations, IEML serves as its own metalanguage
3. **Computable Semantics**: Not only syntactically computable but also semantically computable—semantic relations are computable functions of syntactic relations
4. **Natural Language Expressivity**: Has the expressive power of a natural language with an algebraic structure
5. **Web Standards Compliance**: Complies with Web standards and can be exported in RDF

## USLs: Uniform Semantic Locators

IEML expressions are called **USLs (Uniform Semantic Locators)**. They can be read and translated into any natural language. The dictionary has been translated into French and English and could translate any natural language.

## The Semantic Sphere

The **semantic sphere** brings together all possible texts in the IEML language, translated into natural languages, including the semantic relations between all texts. On this conceptual playing field:
- Dialogue and intersubjectivity arise
- Pragmatic complexity emerges
- Open games allow free regulation of categorization and evaluation of data
- Ecosystems of ideas representing collective cognitive processes can be cultivated in an interoperable environment

## Applications

IEML is intended for use across multiple disciplines:

- **[[knowledge/tools-and-technology/specialized-technologies/artificial-intelligence/index|Artificial Intelligence]]**: Foundations for a new generation of AI with computable meaning
- **Business Intelligence**: Unified semantic layer across disparate data sources
- **Data Science**: Semantic interoperability between databases and disciplines
- **Digital Humanities**: Heritage conservation and cultural knowledge representation
- **Digital Communications**: Enhanced metadata and content discovery
- **Knowledge Management**: Reflexive collective intelligence systems

## Relationship to Semantic AI

IEML is closely related to [[semantic-ai|Semantic AI]] in that it serves as a foundation for semantic computation and semantic interoperability between systems. It is part of a **neuro-symbolic architecture** (specifically a neuro-semantic architecture) that emphasizes solving the problem of semantic computation.

IEML addresses the challenge of **semantic interoperability** among databases, languages, and disciplines by providing:
- Unambiguous and computable semantics
- A concept coding system that reconciles maximum originality and complexity with interoperability
- A coordinate system for a common knowledge base feeding both automatic reasoning and statistical calculations

This fulfills the promise of the **Semantic Web** through computable meaning and interoperable ontologies.

## A Project for a New Humanism

Lévy positions IEML as more than a technical tool—it is "a project for a new humanism." By enabling reflexive collective intelligence, IEML aims to augment human collective thought in the algorithmic medium, fitting new institutions to the new technological environment.

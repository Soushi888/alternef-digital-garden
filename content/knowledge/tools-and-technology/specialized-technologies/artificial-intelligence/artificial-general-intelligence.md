**Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** is a *hypothetical* form of artificial intelligence that would match or surpass human cognitive abilities across virtually all intellectual tasks. Unlike today's AI systems, which are designed for specific functions, AGI aims to replicate the broad, adaptable intelligence seen in humans.

AGI is also known as **strong AI**, **full AI**, or **human-level AI**. It represents the long-term goal of creating machines capable of general reasoning, learning, and problem-solving without task-specific programming.

## Key Characteristics of AGI

For a system to be considered AGI, researchers generally agree it must demonstrate several core capabilities:

- **Reasoning and problem-solving** under uncertainty
- **Knowledge representation**, including common sense understanding
- **Planning and goal-setting** across domains
- **Learning from experience** and adapting to new situations
- **Natural language communication** at a human level
- **Integration of skills** to achieve complex goals

Additional traits like **imagination**, **autonomy**, and **self-awareness** are often discussed, though not universally required. Some frameworks also include the ability to **sense** (e.g., see, hear) and **act** (e.g., manipulate objects, navigate environments).

## AGI vs Narrow AI and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)

### 1. Narrow AI (Weak AI)

Current AI systems fall under **narrow AI**, meaning they excel in specific, predefined tasks—like image recognition, language translation, or game playing—but cannot generalize beyond their training. Examples include **self-driving cars**, **chatbots**, and **recommendation engines**.

### 2. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)

AGI would transcend specialization, **transferring knowledge between domains** and solving novel problems it wasn't explicitly trained on—much like a human can switch from cooking to writing to repairing a bike.

### 3. Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)

Beyond AGI lies **artificial superintelligence (ASI)**, a theoretical AI that **vastly outperforms humans in every cognitive domain**. ASI could trigger an "intelligence explosion," where AI systems recursively improve themselves, leading to rapid technological advancement.

A 2023 Google DeepMind framework classifies AGI into five levels: **emerging**, **competent**, **expert**, **virtuoso**, and **superhuman** (i.e., ASI). They suggest models like **ChatGPT** or **LLaMA 2** may represent *emerging AGI*, comparable to unskilled humans.

## Current Status and Research

As of 2026, **true AGI does not exist**. Most experts believe we are **decades away**, if not more. However, progress in [[large-language-models|large language models]] (LLMs) has reignited interest and investment.

Major tech companies—including **OpenAI**, **Google**, **Meta**, and **xAI**—have AGI as a stated long-term goal. A 2020 survey identified **72 active AGI research projects across 37 countries**, reflecting global interest.

Despite advances, significant roadblocks remain, such as **developing common sense reasoning**, **ensuring robust generalization**, and **achieving autonomous learning** without massive data inputs.

## Potential Impacts and Risks

AGI could revolutionize fields like **healthcare**, **education**, **scientific research**, and **engineering**, enabling breakthroughs in areas like **nanotechnology**, **energy**, and **cognitive enhancement**.

However, AGI also poses **existential risks**. Some experts argue that uncontrolled AGI development could lead to unintended consequences, including **loss of human control** or **societal disruption**. The idea of an "intelligence explosion" raises concerns about rapid, unpredictable change.

Conversely, others believe AGI is so far off that current fears are premature. The debate continues over whether AGI risk mitigation should be a **global priority**.

## Tests for Human-Level AGI

Several benchmarks have been proposed to assess whether AGI has been achieved:

- **The Turing Test**: A machine passes if it can convince a human it's human during conversation. While some chatbots have claimed success, most experts consider this insufficient proof of true intelligence.
- **AI-Complete Problems**: Tasks like **natural language understanding** or **computer vision in dynamic environments** are considered "AI-hard," meaning they likely require AGI to solve robustly.
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Google DeepMind's framework evaluates AGI based on outperforming humans in a wide range of non-physical tasks.

Ultimately, no single test is universally accepted, and the definition of intelligence itself remains philosophically contested.

**Large language models (LLMs)** are advanced artificial intelligence systems trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. They are built on **[[transformers|transformer architectures]]**, neural networks that use self-attention mechanisms to process entire sequences of text in parallel, enabling them to capture complex context and relationships between words.

## How LLMs Work

LLMs function as **statistical prediction machines**, repeatedly predicting the next word in a sequence based on patterns learned during training. This allows them to perform diverse tasks such as:

- **Text generation** - Creating coherent, contextual content
- **Summarization** - Condensing long texts into key points
- **Translation** - Converting text between languages
- **Code writing** - Generating and explaining programming code
- **Conversational AI** - Engaging in natural dialogue

## Notable Examples

Well-known LLMs include:
- **ChatGPT** (OpenAI)
- **Gemini** (Google)
- **Llama** (Meta)
- **Bing Chat** (Microsoft)
- **Claude** (Anthropic)
- **Mistral** and **DeepSeek** (open-weight models)

## Training Process

These models are typically:
1. **Pre-trained** on massive datasets—often sourced from the internet
2. **Fine-tuned** for specific applications or domains
3. Guided via **prompt engineering** to achieve desired outputs

They represent a major leap in human-machine interaction, enabling natural language communication without predefined commands.

## Limitations and Challenges

Despite their capabilities, LLMs have notable limitations:

- **Hallucinations** - Can invent false information that sounds plausible
- **Inherited biases** - Reflect biases present in training data
- **Vulnerability** - Susceptible to malicious inputs and prompt injection
- **Context limitations** - Constrained by context window sizes
- **Lack of reasoning** - Pattern matching rather than true understanding

## Current Developments

The field is rapidly evolving:
- **Open-weight models** (like Mistral and DeepSeek) are increasing accessibility
- **Multimodal LLMs** are expanding beyond text to handle images, audio, and more
- **Reasoning models** are improving logical capabilities
- **Agent frameworks** enable LLMs to use tools and take actions

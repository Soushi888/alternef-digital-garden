Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI systems can be categorized into two main types:

1. **Narrow AI**: Also known as weak AI, it is designed to perform a narrow task, such as voice recognition or driving a car. Narrow AI is designed to perform a specific task and does not possess the ability to understand or learn beyond that task.
2. **General AI**: Also known as strong AI, it refers to systems that possess the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at or above human level. General AI is still a theoretical concept and has not been fully realized.

AI technologies are used in various applications, including search engines, recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, and natural language processing. The development of AI has been driven by advancements in machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks, which enable computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions.

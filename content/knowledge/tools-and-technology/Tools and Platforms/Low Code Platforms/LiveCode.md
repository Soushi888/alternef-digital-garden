LiveCode makes it easy to turn your concepts, ideas or designs into powerful applications. You can create desktop, Internet, database and network applications. LiveCode includes a complete graphical user interface builder, as well as the tools you need to produce faceless or background applications.

LiveCode is easy to learn. If you are a complete beginner to the world of programming, you will find you can become productive quickly. If you are an experienced programmer, you will find the environment extremely powerful and one of the most productive you have used.

LiveCode’s programming language is object-based. This makes it easy to write modules of code that are attached directly to individual objects. Unlike other languages, LiveCode lets you both run and edit an application live. Traditionally the run, edit, compile and debug cycle in programming takes up a lot of time. In LiveCode all of these activities can take place together.

If you’re coming from another language, you’ll appreciate that the LiveCode language is typeless, with data automatically stored in the most efficient format and converted, so you don’t have to learn how to deal with different types of data. Memory management is fully automatic. LiveCode applications are not interpreted in the traditional sense, so they provide excellent performance. A LiveCode graphical application will often feel more responsive to use than a Java application, and take less time to write.

A LiveCode application is completely cross-platform. That means you can run any application you create on all major modern operating systems, including Windows, Linux, Unix and Mac OS. Unlike most other cross-platform frameworks, a LiveCode application will always look and feel native on each platform that you deliver it on. You can take advantage of many platform specific features on each platform.

LiveCode removes the need to learn how to access most individual programming interfaces for each operating system. This saves you the time and effort of learning thousands of platform-specific interface calls.

## Overview

A digital garden is an evolving, non-linear approach to creating and sharing personal knowledge online. Unlike traditional blogs or static websites, digital gardens are living, growing collections of interconnected thoughts, notes, and ideas that develop and mature over time.

## Key Characteristics

### 1. Organic Knowledge Growth

- Thoughts are treated as seeds that grow and evolve
- Content is continuously updated and refined
- Embraces the concept of work-in-progress

### 2. Interconnected Knowledge

- Uses bi-directional linking
- Creates a network of related ideas
- Allows for serendipitous discovery of connections

### 3. Personal Knowledge Management

- Serves as a personal learning and reflection tool
- Encourages continuous learning and iteration
- Provides a transparent view of intellectual development

## Technical Implementation

### Typical Components

- [[markdown|Markdown]]-based content management
- Static site generators (e.g., [[quartz]])
- [[wiki|Wiki-style]] knowledge organization
- Knowledge graph visualization
- Bi-directional linking mechanisms

### Popular Tools

- [[quartz]]
- [[obsidian|Obsidian Publish]]
- Roam Research
- Notion
- Foam (VS Code extension)

## Philosophical Underpinnings

### Inspiration Sources

- [[Personal Knowledge Management]]
- [[Zettelkasten]] method
- [[wiki|Wiki]]-style non-linear thinking

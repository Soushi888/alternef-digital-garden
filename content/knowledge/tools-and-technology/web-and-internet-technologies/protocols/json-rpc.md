JSON-RPC (Remote Procedure Call) is a protocol used for remote procedure calls, typically between a client and a server over a network. It uses the [[JavaScript Object Notation]] (JavaScript Object Notation) data format for data serialization and transmission, and it is designed to be lightweight and efficient.

JSON-RPC defines a standardized format for messages exchanged between a client and server. The client sends a request message to the server, specifying the name of the method to be called and any required parameters. The server then sends a response message back to the client, containing the result of the method call.

JSON-RPC supports both synchronous and asynchronous method calls, and it can be used with a variety of transport protocols, including [[HTTP]] and [[WebSockets|WebSocket]].

One of the advantages of using JSON-RPC is that it is language-agnostic, meaning that it can be used with any programming language that can work with JSON. It is also relatively easy to implement, making it a popular choice for building APIs and microservices.

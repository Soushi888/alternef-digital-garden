Tokenomics is the study of the economic systems within blockchain networks, focusing on how tokens are designed, distributed, and managed to create sustainable and valuable ecosystems.

## Key Components

1. **Token Supply**
   - Initial distribution
   - Emission schedule
   - Maximum supply vs circulating supply
   - Inflation/deflation mechanisms

2. **Token Utility**
   - Governance rights
   - Network access
   - Value exchange
   - Staking and rewards

3. **Distribution Mechanisms**
   - Initial coin offerings (ICOs)
   - Token airdrops
   - Mining rewards
   - Staking rewards

## Economic Models

- **Proof of Work**: Mining-based token distribution
- **Proof of Stake**: Staking-based validation and rewards
- **Bonding Curves**: Dynamic pricing mechanisms
- **Token Burning**: Deflationary mechanisms

## Governance

- Community voting systems
- Proposal mechanisms
- Treasury management
- Protocol upgrades

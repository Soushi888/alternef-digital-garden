# Liquid Network

[[bitcoin|Bitcoin]] federated sidechain and layer-2 solution enabling fast, confidential transactions and digital asset issuance.

> *Bitcoin's leading sidechain, enabling fast, confidential transactions, and the issuance of assets.* ‚Äî [Blockstream](https://blockstream.com/liquid/)

## Overview

The **Liquid Network** is an open-source federated [[bitcoin]] sidechain developed by [Blockstream](https://blockstream.com) that serves as a layer-2 solution interoperable with the [[lightning-network]]. It enables faster, more confidential Bitcoin transactions while supporting the issuance and exchange of digital assets including stablecoins, tokenized securities, and bonds.

### Key Milestone (2025)

### ‚ö° Performance Benefits
- **1-Minute Block Times**: Consistent, non-variable block generation
- **2-Block Finality**: Transactions settle in 2-3 minutes under normal conditions
- **High Throughput**: Handles larger transaction volumes than Bitcoin mainnet
- **Lower Fees**: Reduced transaction costs compared to mainnet

### üè¶ Digital Asset Issuance
- **Issued Assets**: Create new tokens representing fiat, securities, or digital assets
- **Stablecoins**: USD-T (Tether), USDC, and other pegged assets

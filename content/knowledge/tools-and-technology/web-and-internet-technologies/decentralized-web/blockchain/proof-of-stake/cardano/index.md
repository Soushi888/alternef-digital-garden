## Cardano: Next-Generation Blockchain Platform

Cardano is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that aims to provide an alternative to existing blockchain technologies through a research-driven approach and a focus on sustainability, scalability, and interoperability.

## Core Characteristics

1. **Proof of Stake Consensus**
   - Ouroboros Proof of Stake (PoS) protocol
   - Energy-efficient blockchain validation
   - Secure and decentralized network consensus

2. **Multi-Layer Architecture**
   - Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL)
   - Cardano Computation Layer (CCL)
   - Enables complex smart contract functionality

3. **Research-Driven Development**
   - Academic peer-review of protocols
   - Formal verification of smart contracts
   - Continuous improvement through scientific methodology

The NEAR [[Blockchain]] is a user-friendly, carbon-neutral, and infinitely scalable blockchain designed with performance, security, and usability in mind. It is a layer one, sharded, [[Proof of Stake|proof-of-stake]] blockchain, which means it operates on a single, continuous chain that is divided into smaller pieces (shards) to improve scalability and efficiency. NEAR is built to be environmentally friendly, consuming significantly less energy than Bitcoin, for example, consuming the same amount of energy Bitcoin does in just 3 minutes in a year.

NEAR offers built-in features such as named accounts and account abstraction, making it easier for developers to work with. It provides all the necessary infrastructure for developers to build applications, including smart contracts and indexers, while also being interoperable with other blockchains. This interoperability allows NEAR to connect with various other blockchain networks, enhancing its utility and accessibility for a wide range of applications.

In summary, NEAR is a blockchain platform that emphasizes usability, security, scalability, and environmental sustainability, making it an attractive choice for developers and users looking to build and interact with decentralized applications.

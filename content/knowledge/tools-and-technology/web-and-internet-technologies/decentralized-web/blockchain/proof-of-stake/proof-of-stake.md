Proof of Stake (PoS) is a [[consensus-algorithm|consensus algorithm]] used by certain [[blockchain|Blockchain]] networks to validate transactions and create new blocks. Unlike [[knowledge/tools-and-technology/web-and-internet-technologies/decentralized-web/blockchain/proof-of-work/index|Proof of Work]] (PoW), which requires miners to solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks, Proof of Stake relies on the economic stake or ownership interest that validators have in the network.

In a Proof of Stake system, validators are chosen to create new blocks and validate transactions based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to "stake" as collateral. This means that the more coins a validator holds, the higher the chance they have of being selected to validate transactions and create new blocks. This mechanism is designed to be more energy-efficient than [[knowledge/tools-and-technology/web-and-internet-technologies/decentralized-web/blockchain/proof-of-work/index|Proof of Work]], as it does not require the intensive computational power needed to solve puzzles.

The main advantage of Proof of Stake is its scalability and efficiency. It allows for faster transaction processing times and lower energy consumption compared to [[Proof of Work]]. However, it also introduces new challenges, such as the risk of centralization if a small number of validators control a significant portion of the network's stake. To mitigate this risk, many Proof of Stake systems implement mechanisms like slashing (penalizing validators for malicious behavior) and delegation (allowing token holders to delegate their stake to validators), which help maintain a decentralized network.

Proof of Stake is used by various blockchain platforms, including Ethereum 2.0, Cardano, and Tezos, among others. These platforms are transitioning from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake to improve scalability, reduce energy consumption, and enhance the network's security and sustainability.

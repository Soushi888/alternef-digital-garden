[Butane | Decentralized Synthetic Assets for Cardano](https://butane.dev)
> Butane protocol is an advanced synthetics assets platform on the Cardano blockchain.

Butane in the [[Cardano]] ecosystem refers to the Butane Protocol, a decentralized synthetic assets platform built on the Cardano blockchain. This protocol enables the creation and trading of synthetic assets that are pegged to real-world assets such as [[Bitcoin]] (BTC), the US Dollar (USD), and the Nasdaq Composite index. Here are the key features and developments related to Butane:

- **Open Protocol**: Butane operates on an open protocol that avoids locking or batching requirements, aiming to provide a more accessible and flexible environment for users engaging with synthetic assets.
- **Atomic Liquidations**: One of the unique features of Butane is its implementation of atomic liquidations, which are designed to ensure smoother and more efficient liquidation transactions compared to traditional methods. This feature is particularly beneficial for minimizing congestion and enhancing scalability within the Cardano ecosystem.
- **Interest Rates Over Fixed Fees**: Unlike many other platforms, Butane uses interest rates instead of fixed fees, providing a more mature financial product experience for users.
- **Community Engagement**: Butane has shown a strong commitment to community engagement, as evidenced by its recent airdrop snapshot initiative. This strategy leverages social media to increase participation and awareness among potential users.
- **Development Timeline**: The Butane team plans to launch the Cardano testnet in late December 2023, followed by auditing and launching the Cardano mainnet in early 2024. The protocol's source code is expected to be open-sourced in Q1 2024, and decentralized governance is anticipated by Q3 2024.
- **Butane Token (BTN)**: The Butane Token (BTN) serves multiple functions within the Butane ecosystem, acting as a fee token, governance token, and facilitating liquidity provider (LP) farming. This multifaceted utility supports various aspects of decentralized finance (DeFi) operations on the platform.
- **Launch Details**: The Butane Token (BTN) is set to be launched by Flame Company Laboratory Proprietary Limited (Flame Labs), an Australian private company, on February 23, 2024, marking a significant development in the Cardano DeFi landscape.

Butane represents a significant advancement in the Cardano ecosystem, offering innovative solutions for synthetic asset management and contributing to the broader goals of decentralization and financial inclusion within the blockchain space.

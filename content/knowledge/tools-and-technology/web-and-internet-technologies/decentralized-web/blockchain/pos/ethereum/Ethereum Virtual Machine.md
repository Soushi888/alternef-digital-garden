The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a foundational component of the [[Ethereum]] [[Blockchain]] platform, serving as the runtime environment for executing smart contracts and [[Decentralized Application]] (DApps). It operates as a decentralized computer that runs on the global network of Ethereum nodes, processing and executing code written in Ethereum’s native programming language, Solidity, or other compatible languages. The EVM is Turing-complete, meaning it can theoretically perform any computation, making it a versatile platform for creating DApps. It ensures that code execution is isolated and secure, preventing malicious code from affecting the entire network. Ethereum developers compile their smart contracts into bytecode that can be executed by the EVM, and the resulting code is immutable once deployed on the blockchain. 

The EVM is responsible for processing transactions, which trigger the execution of code that can read from and write to the Ethereum state (the distributed ledger), enabling the creation of decentralized applications with various functionalities like decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and more. The EVM’s decentralized and deterministic execution ensures that all nodes on the Ethereum network reach consensus on the state changes caused by these transactions, maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of the blockchain.

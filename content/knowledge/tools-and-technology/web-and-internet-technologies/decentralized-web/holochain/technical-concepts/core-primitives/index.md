# Core Primitives

Essential technical concepts that form the building blocks of every Holochain application. These primitives are fundamental to understanding how Holochain works at a technical level.

## Validation and State Management

### [[action|Actions]]
The fundamental operations that can be performed in a Holochain application and how they're validated.

### [[progenitor|Progenitor]]
The foundational concept for establishing identity and authority in distributed systems.

### [[eventual-consistency|Eventual Consistency]]
How Holochain maintains data consistency across distributed nodes without central coordination.

## Data Organization and Discovery

### [[anchor|Anchors]]
Fixed reference points in the DHT that enable efficient data discovery and organization.

### [[path|Paths]]
Hierarchical addressing system for organizing and finding data in the distributed hash table.

### [[signal|Signals]]
Real-time communication mechanism between agents in the network.

## Learning Path

1. **[[action|Actions]]** - Understand the fundamental operations
2. **[[progenitor|Progenitor]]** - Learn about identity establishment
3. **[[anchor|Anchors]] & [[path|Paths]]** - Master data organization
4. **[[eventual-consistency|Eventual Consistency]]** - Understand distributed coordination
5. **[[signal|Signals]]** - Explore real-time communication

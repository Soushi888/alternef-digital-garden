## Overview

P2P Shipyard is a development toolkit designed to simplify the creation of cross-platform peer-to-peer (P2P) applications, with a primary focus on [[knowledge/tools-and-technology/web-and-internet-technologies/decentralized-web/holochain/index|Holochain]]-based projects. It enables developers to build and deploy applications across multiple platforms, including Android, Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Platform Development**: Build P2P applications that run seamlessly on multiple operating systems
- **Holochain Integration**: Specifically designed to work with Holochain's P2P architecture
- **Tauri Framework**: Utilizes Tauri for creating lightweight, secure desktop and mobile applications

## Project Status

- **Current State**: Source-Available software
- **Development Goal**: Transition to fully Open Source
- **Funding**: Community-supported through [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/darksoil/projects/p2pshipyard)

## Supported Holochain Versions

- `main` branch: Latest stable Holochain release
- `main-0.3`: Supports Holochain 0.3.x
- `main-0.4`: Supports Holochain 0.4.x

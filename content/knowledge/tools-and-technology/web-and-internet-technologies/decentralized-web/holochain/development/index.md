## Overview of Holochain Development

This section provides comprehensive resources for developers looking to build applications on the Holochain framework. From getting started guides to advanced development techniques, these materials will help you navigate the Holochain development ecosystem.

## Development Resources

### Core Guides

- [[holochain-development-guide|Holochain Development Guide]] - Essential knowledge for Holochain developers
- [[how-to-design-an-holochain-application|How to Design a Holochain Application]] - Architectural considerations and best practices
- [[lair-keystore|Lair Keystore]] - Secure key management for Holochain applications

### Development Tools

- [[holochain-scaffolding-tool|Holochain Scaffolding Tool]] - Rapid application development toolkit
- [[p2p-shipyard|P2P Shipyard]] - Peer-to-peer development environment

### Training Materials

- [[holochain-dev-training/|Holochain Developer Training]] - Structured learning resources for new developers

### Holochain Development Kit (HDK)

- [[hdk/|Holochain Development Kit]] - Core libraries and APIs for building Holochain applications

## Development Workflow

1. **Setup Environment** - Install Rust, Holochain, and development tools
2. **Design Application** - Plan your data model and application architecture
3. **Implement DNA** - Develop the core logic of your application
4. **Test Locally** - Use test utilities to validate your implementation
5. **Deploy** - Package and distribute your hApp

## Best Practices

- Design for agent-centricity from the beginning
- Implement validation rules for all entries
- Use capability tokens for access control
- Consider eventual consistency in your data model
- Leverage existing patterns and libraries when possible

## Common Challenges

- Understanding the agent-centric paradigm
- Designing effective validation rules
- Managing complex data relationships
- Implementing secure access control
- Testing distributed application behavior

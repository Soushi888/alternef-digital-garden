## Overview of Holochain Concepts

This section provides detailed explanations of the core concepts and terminology that form the foundation of Holochain's distributed computing framework. Understanding these concepts is essential for developing applications and working effectively with the Holochain ecosystem.

## Core Concepts

### Agent-Centric Components

- [[action|Action]] - Operations that agents perform on their source chains
- [[entry|Entry]] - The basic unit of data in Holochain
- [[cell|Cell]] - The fundamental unit of agency in Holochain
- [[capability-tokens|Capability Tokens]] - Authorization mechanism for Holochain applications

### Network Architecture

- [[link|Link]] - Connections between entries in the DHT
- [[path|Path]] - Addressing mechanism for content in Holochain
- [[signal|Signal]] - Real-time messaging between agents
- [[network-seed|Network Seed]] - Initialization parameter for Holochain networks
- [[rrdht|RRDHT]] - Redundant, Resilient Distributed Hash Table

### Roles and Identities

- [[host|Host]] - Entity that provides computing resources for Holochain applications
- [[guest|Guest]] - User of Holochain applications without hosting responsibilities
- [[progenitor|Progenitor]] - Initial creator of a Holochain DNA or network

### Conceptual Frameworks

- [[web3|Web3]] - Relationship between Holochain and Web3 technologies
- [[layer0|Layer0]] - Holochain's position in the protocol stack
- [[social-dna|Social DNA]] - Patterns for social applications in Holochain
- [[eventual-consistency|Eventual Consistency]] - Data synchronization model in distributed systems
- [[anchor|Anchor]] - Discoverable entry points in Holochain applications
- [[record|Record]] - Signed data entries with provenance information

## Learning Pathways

### For Developers
1. Start with [[entry]], [[action]], and [[cell]] to understand the basic building blocks
2. Explore [[link]], [[path]], and [[anchor]] to learn about data relationships
3. Study [[capability-tokens]] and [[signal]] for application interaction patterns

### For Architects
1. Begin with [[rrdht]] and [[eventual-consistency]] for distributed systems concepts
2. Examine [[network-seed]] and [[progenitor]] for network initialization
3. Understand [[layer0]] and [[web3]] for contextual positioning

### For Application Designers
1. Focus on [[social-dna]] and [[anchor]] for application patterns
2. Learn about [[host]] and [[guest]] for deployment considerations
3. Study [[capability-tokens]] for security and authorization models

# What is Holochain?

Holochain is a framework for building peer-to-peer applications and agent-centric distributed systems. It offers a revolutionary approach to decentralized computing that differs significantly from blockchain-based systems.

## Technological Context

### Emerging Paradigms

1. [[../../../../../../infrastructure-and-networks/distributed-systems/index|Distributed Systems]]
2. [[../../peer-to-peer/index|Peer-to-Peer Networks]]
3. [[../../index|Decentralized Technology]]
4. [[../concepts/local-first|Local-first Software]]
5. [[../concepts/web3|Web3]]

## Overview

Holochain is a development platform that enables the creation of distributed applications without relying on centralized blockchain architecture. Its agent-centric and biomimetic approach makes it a unique alternative in the Web3 ecosystem.

## Fundamental Architecture

### Key Concepts

1. **[[../concepts/action|Agent]]** - The fundamental unit; each user is an autonomous agent
2. **[[../concepts/source-chain|Source Chain]]** - Personal cryptographic history chain for each agent
3. **[[../concepts/distributed-hash-table|Distributed Hash Table]]** - Distributed storage space for data sharing
4. **Validation Rules** - Ensure system integrity through distributed validation
5. **[[../concepts/agent-centric|Agent-Centric Architecture]]** - Unique design paradigm

### Application Structure

1. **hApp** - Complete Holochain application
2. **DNA** - Rules and business logic
3. **[[../concepts/zome|Zome]]** - Functional modules of a DNA
4. **[[../architecture/conductor|Conductor]]** - Runtime that executes hApps
5. **[[../concepts/capability-tokens|Capability Tokens]]** - Permission management

## Development

### Technical Ecosystem

1. **Language**: [[knowledge/tools-and-technology/programming-and-software-development/languages/rust/index|Rust]]
2. **Frameworks**:
   - HDK (Holochain Development Kit)
   - HDI (Holochain Development Interface)
3. **Tools**:
   - [[../development/holochain-scaffolding-tool|Holochain Scaffolding tool]]
   - [[../development/lair-keystore|Lair Keystore]]

### Development Approaches

1. Functional Programming
2. Reactive Programming
3. Distributed Computing
4. Modular Architecture
5. Event-Driven Design

## Use Cases

### Governance Models

1. DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations)
2. Voting Systems
3. Reputation Systems
4. Distributed Governance
5. Collaborative Platforms

### Emerging Applications

1. Decentralized Social Networks
2. Reputation Systems
3. Mutual Currencies
4. Sharing Economy
5. Coordination Tools

## Philosophical Concepts

1. Biomimetic Design - Systems inspired by natural patterns
2. Holistic Systems - Considering the whole rather than just parts
3. Cryptographic Autonomy - Preserving user sovereignty
4. Self-Organizing Systems - Emergent order without central control
5. Regenerative Technology - Creating systems that build capacity over time

## Ecosystem

### Core Components

1. **[[../cryptographic-autonomy-license|Cryptographic Autonomy License]]** - Protects user autonomy
2. **[[../development/index|Development]]** - Tools and resources
3. **[[../ecosystem/index|Ecosystem]]** - Projects and community

## Key Differentiators from Blockchain

1. **Agent-Centricity** - Focus on individual agency rather than global consensus
2. **Scalability** - Naturally scales with the number of users
3. **Energy Efficiency** - No mining or proof-of-work required
4. **Data Sovereignty** - Users control their own data
5. **Application-Specific Validation** - Rules tailored to each application

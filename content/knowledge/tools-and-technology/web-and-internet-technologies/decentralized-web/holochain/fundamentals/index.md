# Holochain Fundamentals

This section covers the essential concepts that form the foundation of Holochain technology. These are the core building blocks that every Holochain developer and user should understand.

## Core Data Structures

### [[cell|Cells]]
The fundamental unit of a Holochain application - combining source chain and DHT space.

### [[entry|Entries]]
The basic data structure that gets stored in the distributed hash table and source chain.

### [[record|Records]]
Complete data structures that contain entries along with their metadata and validation information.

### [[link|Links]]
Connections between entries that create relationships in the distributed hash table.

## Learning Path

1. Start with **[[cell|Cells]]** to understand the basic architecture
2. Learn about **[[entry|Entries]]** as the fundamental data unit
3. Understand **[[record|Records]]** for complete data handling
4. Explore **[[link|Links]]** for creating data relationships

## Next Steps

After mastering these fundamentals, explore:

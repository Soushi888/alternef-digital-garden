# Holochain Applications

This section explores the diverse range of applications and use cases for Holochain technology. From social networks to supply chain management, Holochain's agent-centric architecture enables new approaches to solving complex coordination problems.

## Application Domains

### [[knowledge/tools-and-technology/web-and-internet-technologies/decentralized-web/holochain/applications/holochain-applications-overview|Holochain Use Cases Overview]]

- Comprehensive overview of application domains
- Key benefits for different use case categories
- Implementation considerations

## Primary Use Case Categories

### Social Coordination

- Social networks and communities
- Collaborative platforms
- Reputation systems
- Governance and decision-making

### Resource Management

- Supply chain tracking
- Asset management
- Resource sharing and coordination
- Environmental monitoring

### Data Sovereignty

- Personal data management
- Identity systems
- Consent-based data sharing
- Privacy-preserving applications

### Distributed Markets

- Peer-to-peer marketplaces
- Local exchange trading systems
- Mutual credit systems
- Tokenless value exchange

## Implementation Examples

### Current Projects

- Junto - Social media platform
- Kizuna - Community coordination
- Sacred Capital - Reputation systems
- Holo REA - Resource-event-agent accounting

### Potential Applications

- Decentralized healthcare records
- Community energy management

## Development Considerations

- Agent-centric design principles
- Data modeling for distributed applications
- Validation rule design
- User experience in distributed systems

## Getting Started with Use Cases

1. Identify the coordination problem you're solving
2. Determine if agent-centricity benefits your use case
3. Design your data model and validation rules
4. Prototype and test with target users
5. Iterate based on feedback

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language designed to be easy to read, write, and convert to structured formats like HTML. Created by John Gruber in 2004, it allows writers to format text using a plain-text editing approach that's both human-readable and machine-parsable.

## Core Philosophy

### Readability

- Text looks clean and understandable even in raw form
- Minimal syntax that doesn't interfere with content
- Focuses on writing, not complex formatting

### Portability

- Works across multiple platforms
- Can be converted to many formats
- Platform-independent

## Basic Syntax

### Headings

```markdown
# Largest Heading
## Second Level
### Third Level
```

### Text Formatting

```markdown
*Italic* or _Italic_
**Bold** or __Bold__
***Bold and Italic***
~~Strikethrough~~
```

### Lists

```markdown
- Unordered list item
* Another way to do unordered list
1. Ordered list
2. Second item
```

### Links and References

```markdown
[Link Text](https://example.com)
[[Wikilink Style]]
```

### Code Blocks

````markdown
Inline `code`

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```
````

## Advanced Features

### Tables

```markdown
| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
```

### Task Lists

```markdown
- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Incomplete task
```

### Footnotes

```markdown
Here's a sentence with a footnote.[^1]

[^1]: This is the footnote.
```

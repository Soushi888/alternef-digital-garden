Git is a [free and open source](https://git-scm.com/about/free-and-open-source) distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Git is [easy to learn](https://git-scm.com/doc) and has a [tiny footprint with lightning fast performance](https://git-scm.com/about/small-and-fast). It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like [cheap local branching](https://git-scm.com/about/branching-and-merging), convenient [staging areas](https://git-scm.com/about/staging-area), and [multiple workflows](https://git-scm.com/about/distributed).

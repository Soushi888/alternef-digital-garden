## Overview

Development patterns encompass various approaches to designing, structuring, and implementing software. This section explores different paradigms, design strategies, and construction techniques that guide software development.

## Sections

### 1. Programming Paradigms
Fundamental approaches to writing and organizing code.

#### Foundational Paradigms
- [[functional-programming|Functional Programming]]
- [[object-oriented-programming|Object-Oriented Programming]]
- [[procedural-programming|Procedural Programming]]

#### Emerging Paradigms
- Reactive Programming
- Declarative Programming
- Logic Programming

### 2. Design Patterns
Reusable solutions to common software design problems.

#### Creational Patterns
- Singleton
- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype

#### Structural Patterns
- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Proxy

#### Behavioral Patterns
- Observer
- Strategy
- Command
- State
- Template Method
- [[event-bus|Event Bus Pattern]]

### 3. Architectural Patterns
High-level strategies for system organization.

- Model-View-Controller (MVC)
- Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)
- Event-Driven Architecture
  - [[event-bus|Event Bus Pattern]]
- Microservices
- Layered Architecture

### 4. Construction Patterns
Techniques for building robust and maintainable software.

#### Code Organization
- Dependency Injection
- Inversion of Control
- Composition over Inheritance

#### Error Handling
- Defensive Programming
- Fail-Fast Principle
- Error Propagation Strategies

#### Performance Patterns
- Memoization
- Lazy Initialization
- Object Pooling

## Principles and Best Practices

- SOLID Principles
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

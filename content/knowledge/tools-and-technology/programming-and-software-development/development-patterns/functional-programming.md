## Definition of Functional Programming

Functional Programming (FP) is a declarative programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. It emphasizes immutability, pure functions, and function composition, making programs more predictable and easier to reason about.

## Characteristics of Functional Programming

### 1. Pure Functions
- Deterministic output for the same input
- No side effects
- Easier to test and debug

### 2. Immutability
- Data cannot be changed after creation
- Prevents unexpected state mutations
- Supports concurrent and parallel processing

### 3. First-Class and Higher-Order Functions
- Functions can be assigned to variables
- Functions can be passed as arguments
- Functions can be returned from other functions

### 4. Declarative Style
- Focuses on WHAT to do, not HOW to do it
- Reduces complexity of code
- Improves code readability

## Key Concepts

- Function Composition
- Recursion
- Lazy Evaluation
- Pattern Matching
- Referential Transparency

## Practical Applications

- Functional languages: Haskell, Erlang, Scala
- Functional programming in multi-paradigm languages
  - JavaScript (map, reduce, filter)
  - Python (functional programming modules)
  - Scala (functional features)

## Advantages

- Predictable code behavior
- Easier parallel processing
- Reduced side effects
- Improved code modularity
- Better testability

## Challenges

- Learning curve for developers
- Performance overhead in some implementations
- Less intuitive for some problem domains

UnoCSS is an Atomic [[CSS]] engine that provides a fully customizable and flexible way to write CSS. It's designed to be fast, lightweight, and easy to use, making it an attractive alternative to traditional CSS frameworks like [[Tailwind CSS]].

Here are some key features of UnoCSS:

1. **Atomic CSS**: UnoCSS is built around the concept of atomic CSS, where small, reusable styles (called "atoms") can be combined to create more complex designs.
2. **No core utilities**: Unlike traditional CSS frameworks, UnoCSS doesn't come with a set of pre-defined utilities. Instead, it provides a set of presets that can be customized to fit your specific needs.
3. **Preset-based**: UnoCSS uses presets to define the available styles and variants. This allows developers to create their own custom frameworks or modify existing ones to suit their project's requirements.
4. **Fast and lightweight**: UnoCSS is optimized for performance, making it much faster than other CSS frameworks. According to benchmarks, UnoCSS is 148 times faster than Tailwind CSS and 261 times faster than WindiCSS.
5. **Attributify Mode**: UnoCSS offers an "Attributify Mode" that allows developers to convert utility classes into attributes, making it easier to organize code and reduce HTML clutter.
6. **Variants**: UnoCSS supports variants, which enable conditional styling based on states (e.g., hover, active), screens (e.g., desktop, mobile), and other conditions.
7. **Customizable**: UnoCSS is highly customizable, allowing developers to create their own presets, modify existing ones, or even create a custom CSS framework from scratch.

Overall, UnoCSS is a powerful and flexible tool for building custom CSS frameworks, making it an attractive choice for developers who want more control over their CSS and a faster development experience.

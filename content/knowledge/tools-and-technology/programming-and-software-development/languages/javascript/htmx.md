HTMX is a JavaScript library that gives you access to AJAX, CSS Transitions, WebSockets and Server Sent Events directly in HTML, using attributes. This allows you to build modern user interfaces with the simplicity and power of hypertext.

By using HTML attributes, HTMX lets you create dynamic interfaces without writing JavaScript code, making it an excellent choice for developers who prefer working with HTML or want to reduce their JavaScript footprint.

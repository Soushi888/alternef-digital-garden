**SveltePress**: A content-centered site build tool built on top of SvelteKit, a "serverless-first" framework for building web applications. It's designed to allow users to create and publish content with ease, leveraging the simplicity and performance of Svelte and SvelteKit.

Key features include:

* Filesystem-based structure, enabling content creators to focus on content creation rather than complex configuration
* Built-in support for IBM's Carbon Design System Svelte components, providing a default theme
* Integration with SvelteKit, allowing users to take advantage of its performance and flexibility
* Easy installation using degit or create-sveltepress-app
* Simple and intuitive setup process, making it accessible to users without extensive technical expertise

SveltePress aims to provide a straightforward and efficient way to build and maintain documentation, websites, or other content-driven projects, while still offering the power and customization options of Svelte and SvelteKit.

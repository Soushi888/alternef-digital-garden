## Overview of Functional Programming in JavaScript

[[functional-programming|Functional programming (FP)]] is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. While JavaScript is not a purely functional language, it provides powerful tools for implementing functional programming principles.

## Core Functional Programming Concepts

### Pure Functions

Pure functions are the cornerstone of functional programming:

- Always produce the same output for the same input
- Have no side effects
- Easier to test and reason about

```typescript
// Pure function example
const add = (a: number, b: number): number => a + b
```

### Immutability

Preserving data integrity by avoiding direct mutations:

```typescript
// Immutable array manipulation
const numbers = [1, 2, 3]
const doubled = numbers.map(x => x * 2) // Creates a new array
```

## Advanced Functional Techniques with Effect

### Effect Type and Error Handling

The Effect library revolves around the `Effect<A, E, R>` type, which represents a computation that:
- May succeed with a value of type `A`
- May fail with an error of type `E`
- May require an environment of type `R`

#### Option Type

Safely handle potentially undefined values:

```typescript
import { Option, some, none } from "effect/Option"

const divide = (a: number, b: number): Option<number> => 
  b === 0 ? none() : some(a / b)
```

#### Either Type for Error Handling

Explicit error management:

```typescript
import { Either, left, right } from "effect/Either"

const safeDivide = (a: number, b: number): Either<string, number> => 
  b === 0 ? left('Division by zero') : right(a / b)
```

### Asynchronous Operations with Effect

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect"

const fetchUser = (id: string) =>
  Effect.tryPromise({
    try: () => fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${id}`).then(res => res.json()),
    catch: (error) => new Error(`Failed to fetch user: ${error}`)
  })
```

### Function Composition

```typescript
import { pipe } from "effect"

const addOne = (x: number) => x + 1
const double = (x: number) => x * 2

const addOneThenDouble = pipe(
  5,
  addOne,
  double
) // 12

// With Effect
import { Effect } from "effect"

const safeAddOne = (x: number) => Effect.succeed(x + 1)
const safeDouble = (x: number) => Effect.succeed(x * 2)

const program = pipe(
  Effect.succeed(5),
  Effect.flatMap(safeAddOne),
  Effect.flatMap(safeDouble)
)

// Run the program
const result = Effect.runSync(program) // 12
```

## Practical Benefits

1. **Predictability**: Reduced side effects
2. **Testability**: Easier unit testing
3. **Modularity**: Composable, reusable code
4. **Concurrency**: Built-in tools for managing concurrent operations
5. **Resource Management**: Automatic resource cleanup

## Effect-Specific Features

### Resource Management

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect"

const acquireResource = Effect.acquireRelease(
  // Acquire the resource
  Effect.sync(() => {
    console.log("Resource acquired")
    return { data: "important data" }
  }),
  // Release the resource
  (resource) => Effect.sync(() => {
    console.log("Resource released")
  })
)

// Use the resource safely
const program = Effect.flatMap(
  acquireResource,
  (resource) => Effect.sync(() => {
    console.log(`Using resource: ${resource.data}`)
  })
)
```

### Concurrency

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect"

const task1 = Effect.succeed("Task 1 result")
const task2 = Effect.succeed("Task 2 result")

// Run tasks in parallel
const parallelTasks = Effect.all([task1, task2])

// Run with timeout
const withTimeout = Effect.timeout(parallelTasks, "2 seconds")
```

## Challenges and Considerations

- Learning curve for developers used to imperative programming
- Understanding the Effect type and its operations
- Not all problems are best solved functionally

## Tools and Libraries

- `effect`: Comprehensive functional programming in TypeScript
- `@effect/schema`: Schema validation and parsing
- `@effect/platform`: Platform-specific utilities

## Best Practices

- Prefer `const` over `let`
- Use immutable data structures
- Leverage Effect for managing side effects
- Use pattern matching with `Effect.match`
- Compose effects with `pipe` and `Effect.flatMap`

## Learning Path

1. Understand pure functions
2. Master array methods like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`
3. Learn about immutability
4. Explore the Effect type and error handling
5. Practice function composition with Effect
6. Learn about resource management and concurrency

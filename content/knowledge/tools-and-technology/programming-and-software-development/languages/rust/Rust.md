## Overview of Rust

Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language that emphasizes performance, type safety, and concurrency. Created by Graydon Hoare at Mozilla Research in 2006, Rust has gained significant popularity for its innovative approach to memory safety and systems programming.

## Key Features

### Memory Safety

- Ownership system prevents common memory-related errors
- Borrow checker ensures references do not outlive data
- Guarantees memory safety without garbage collection
- Eliminates null pointer dereferencing and data races

### Performance

- Zero-cost abstractions
- Compile-time guarantees with no runtime overhead
- Direct hardware access
- Comparable performance to C and C++

### Concurrency

- Built-in support for safe concurrent programming
- Prevents data races at compile time
- Lightweight threading model
- Message-passing concurrency

## Core Concepts

### Ownership and Borrowing

- Each value has a single owner
- Ownership can be transferred or borrowed
- Strict compile-time rules prevent common concurrency issues

### Traits and Generics

- Powerful type system with trait-based generics
- Enables flexible and reusable code
- Compile-time polymorphism

### Pattern Matching

- Expressive pattern matching capabilities
- Exhaustive matching ensures comprehensive logic handling
- Seamless integration with algebraic data types

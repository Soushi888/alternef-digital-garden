This tool seeks to be a one-stop shop for building and working with [[knowledge/tools-and-technology/programming-and-software-development/languages/rust/index]]- generated [[WebAssembly]] that you would like to interop with [[JavaScript]], in the browser or with Node.js. `wasm-pack` helps you build rust-generated WebAssembly packages that you could publish to the npm registry, or otherwise use alongside any javascript packages in workflows that you already use, such as [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

This project is a part of the [[Rust and WebAssembly|rust-wasm]] group. You can find more info by visiting that repo!

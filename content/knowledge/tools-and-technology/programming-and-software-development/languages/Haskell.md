## Overview

[Haskell in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qa8IfEeBJqk)

Haskell is a **purely functional, statically typed, lazy, and expressive programming language** with strong mathematical foundations. Developed in the late 1980s and named after logician Haskell Curry, it represents a pinnacle of functional programming research and implementation.

## Key Characteristics

### 1. Purely Functional Paradigm

- **Pure Functions**: Always return the same output for the same input
- **No Side Effects**: Computations are predictable and transparent
- **Immutability**: Data cannot be changed after creation

### 2. Advanced Type System

- **Static Typing**: Type safety at compile-time
- **Hindley-Milner Type Inference**: Automatic type deduction
- **Algebraic Data Types**: Powerful type composition
- **Parametric Polymorphism**: Generic programming capabilities

### 3. Lazy Evaluation

- **On-Demand Computation**: Expressions evaluated only when needed
- **Infinite Data Structures**: Theoretical and practical support
- **Performance Optimization**: Avoids unnecessary computations

### 4. Functional Programming Constructs

- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions as first-class citizens
- **Function Composition**: Combining functions seamlessly
- **Currying**: Partial function application
- **Pattern Matching**: Elegant control flow

## Language Features

### Type System

- Compile-time type checking
- Powerful type inference
- Algebraic data types
- Type classes
- Parametric polymorphism

### Evaluation Strategies

- Lazy evaluation
- Non-strict semantics
- Infinite data structures
- Memoization support

### Concurrency and Parallelism

- Software transactional memory
- Green threads
- Lightweight concurrency primitives
- Parallel list comprehensions

## Code Examples

### Basic Function Definition

```haskell
square :: Int -> Int
square x = x * x
```

### List Comprehension

```haskell
evens = [x | x <- [1..10], even x]  -- [2,4,6,8,10]
```

### Recursive Function

```haskell
factorial :: Int -> Int
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)
```

### Monadic I/O

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
    putStrLn "What is your name?"
    name <- getLine
    putStrLn ("Hello, " ++ name ++ "!")
```

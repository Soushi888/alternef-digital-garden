> Rainlang is defiâ€™s native language. If you know your way around a spreadsheet, you can learn Rain.

Rainlang is an on-chain smart contract language designed for the [[Ethereum Virtual Machine]] (EVM) and other compatible [[Blockchain]] environments. It aims to simplify the process of writing and reading smart contracts by making them more accessible and understandable. Rainlang is characterized by its simplicity, allowing users to write expressions in a human-readable format that can be easily audited without relying on a third party or compiler. This language is designed to be easy to learn, especially for those familiar with spreadsheet formulas, as it uses a sequence of words to perform specific tasks or calculations.

The fundamental building blocks of Rainlang are its words, which perform specific operations or functions. Unlike traditional programming languages, Rainlang does not distinguish between literals, functions, or operators; everything is considered a word. This design allows for a high degree of flexibility, enabling developers to add their own words to the language and tailor it to their specific needs. The language is intentionally vague in its definition of words, which supports the evolution of the language without the constraints of a fixed set of instructions.

Rainlang is also designed to be immutable, meaning that once a contract is deployed, it cannot be upgraded or modified. This feature enhances the security and trustworthiness of smart contracts written in Rainlang. Additionally, Rainlang supports permissionless extensibility, allowing developers to add their own words to the language, further enhancing its adaptability and utility.

Rainlang is not just a language but also forms part of the Rain ecosystem, which includes Raindex, a decentralized exchange (DEX) where all orders are smart contracts written in Rainlang. This innovative approach to DEX design leverages the simplicity and flexibility of Rainlang to enable perpetual, algorithmic strategies.

The partnership between Rainlang and [[Outils et Technologie/DWeb/Holochain/Holochain]], as highlighted in the blog post, further emphasizes the potential of Rainlang to simplify smart contracts and make them more accessible to a wider audience. This collaboration aims to unlock new possibilities in the Web3 space by combining the ease of use of Rainlang with the peer-to-peer application framework of Holochain.

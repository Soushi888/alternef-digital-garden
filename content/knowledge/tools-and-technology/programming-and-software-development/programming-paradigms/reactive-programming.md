## Overview

Reactive Programming is a declarative programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change. It provides an elegant way to handle asynchronous data flows and event-based systems.

## Key Characteristics

- **Stream-Based**: Everything is a stream of data
- **Declarative**: Describe the flow of data, not the control flow
- **Propagation of Change**: Automatic updates when data changes
- **Asynchronous**: Handles events and data streams efficiently

## Relationship with Event Bus Pattern

The [[event-bus|Event Bus Pattern]] is a key implementation technique in Reactive Programming:

- Enables decoupled communication
- Facilitates event stream management
- Provides a mechanism for handling complex event flows

## Implementation Techniques

### Observables and Streams

```typescript
// Example of a simple reactive stream
const numberStream = new Observable<number>(subscriber => {
  let count = 0;
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    subscriber.next(count++);
    if (count > 10) {
      subscriber.complete();
      clearInterval(interval);
    }
  }, 1000);
});

numberStream.subscribe({
  next: (value) => console.log(value),
  complete: () => console.log('Stream completed')
});
```

## Practical Applications

- User Interface interactions
- Real-time data processing
- Event-driven architectures
- Network programming
- IoT systems

## Challenges

- Learning curve
- Performance overhead
- Debugging complexity
- Managing complex event flows

## Conclusion

Reactive Programming offers a powerful approach to handling complex, event-driven systems by providing a declarative and stream-oriented programming model.

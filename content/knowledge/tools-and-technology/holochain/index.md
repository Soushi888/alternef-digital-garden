## Overview

Holochain is a revolutionary framework for building decentralized, agent-centric applications. This section explores its core concepts, architecture, practical applications, and community initiatives.

## Sections

- **Core Concepts:** Learn about the fundamental ideas (DNA, HDK, Agent models) behind Holochain.
- **Zomes:** Understand how zomes act as modular building blocks for creating application logic (e.g., user management, consensus, validation).
- **Architecture:** Explore the underlying network structures, data integrity mechanisms, and overall system architecture.
- **Use Cases:** Discover practical examples and case studies showcasing Holochain applications.
- **Community:** Get insights on governance, contribution guidelines, and the ongoing development roadmap.

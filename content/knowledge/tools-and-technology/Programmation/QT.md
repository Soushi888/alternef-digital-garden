QT is a comprehensive framework for creating cross-platform applications with a strong emphasis on graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It is written in [[C++]] and provides a set of libraries and tools for developing applications that can run on various platforms, including desktop operating systems (Windows, macOS, [[Linux]]), embedded devices (cell phones), and more.

**Key Features**

* Abstracts away low-level platform-specific details, allowing developers to focus on application logic
* Provides a rich set of GUI components and tools for building user interfaces
* Supports internationalization and localization
* Offers modules for 3D graphics, networking, distributed systems, in-app advertising, and more
* Extensive community support and a large ecosystem of third-party libraries and tools

**Not a Programming Language**

QT is not a programming language on its own but rather a framework that extends the C++ language with features like signals and slots, making it easier to develop GUI applications.

**In Summary**

QT is an open-source, cross-platform application development framework that enables developers to create robust, feature-rich applications with GUIs that can run on multiple platforms. Its extensive set of libraries, tools, and modules make it a popular choice for developers seeking to create complex applications with a strong focus on user experience.

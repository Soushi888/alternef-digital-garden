Local-first software is a software development approach that prioritizes user control and ownership of their data. It emphasizes the ability to work offline and collaborate across multiple devices while improving security, privacy, and long-term preservation of data[1][2][6]. 

The local-first approach is in contrast to traditional [[Cloud Computing|cloud]]-based or centralized applications that store data on remote servers. Local-first software primarily operates on users' devices and ensures that data remains under their direct control[6]. 

The local-first approach seeks to empower users by providing them with the benefits of collaboration and connectivity while preserving privacy, security, and data autonomy. It combines the convenience of cloud apps, including real-time collaboration and the ability to work on multiple devices, with the prioritization of local data storage and networks[6]. 

While many technologies satisfy some of the goals of local-first software, none are able to satisfy them all. However, there is ongoing research in distributed systems that might be a foundational piece in realizing local-first software in the future[1][2].

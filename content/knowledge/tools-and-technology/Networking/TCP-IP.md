[[Networking]]

The TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. It is the default method of data communication on the Internet, and it specifies how data is exchanged over the internet by providing end-to-end communications that are addressed, transmitted, routed, and received at the destination[2][3]. The suite is commonly referred to as TCP/IP, named after its two primary protocols: TCP and IP. TCP defines how applications can create channels of communication across a network, while IP defines how to address and route each packet to ensure it reaches the right destination[2]. The TCP/IP protocol suite functions as an abstraction layer between internet applications and the underlying network, and it is designed to make networks reliable with the ability to recover from failures[2].

## GO META PLATFORM : META LOW CODE DEVELOPMENT PLATFORM, FOR DEVELOPERS

Low code platforms empower people to build applications with a minimum or no technical knowledge. However, the applications that can be built are limited to the kind of applications a given low code platform was designed for, mainly data driven web applications. And the generated applications are limited to follow the built-in architecture and design.

Generative Objects pioneers the “meta low code” approach, rocketing the versality and power of the original low code approach to a whole new level.

The meta low code approach empowers developers to have full control over the application meta-model and the architecture and design of the generated applications. The application meta-model is the high level, functional language that the low code platform is exposing to non-technical users to create application in a low code way.

Developers can now :

-   Enrich and extend the original Generative Objects meta-model and associated generation templates, to extend the low code platform itself to meet their specific needs.
-   Create full new application meta-models, and associated generation templates. Developers can now literally create full-fledged specific low code platforms, to target any kind of application, design and architecture

Non-tech users can then use the specific low code platform, created by the developers.

## GO PLATFORM : LOW CODE DEVELOPMENT PLATFORM, WITH SPECIAL NON-TECH FOCUS

Ideation is almost all you need to worry about now. Once you know what you want to create, building the tools and applications you need to support and operate your activity or business is straightforward and easy.

GO Platform is the Low Code Development Platform you need to get access to your full power. It is our mission and motivation to bring this new technology generation to all of you, we have taken special care to make it usable without technological expertise needed.

## WITH THE GO PLATFORM, ENVISION AND CREATE APPLICATIONS TO:

-   Manage and operate your data
-   Implement your processes and operate your business or activity
-   Enforce collaboration inside your organization as well as outside, with your partners, users and customers, through extranets and applications accessible from internet, on desktop, tablet or mobile phone.

-   Connect with and enrich your existing data and applications as well as create full new applications and services.

## HOW DOES IT WORK ?

1. You are guided to define the application you need, you express it though functional modelling on the GO platform.

2. Once modelled, your application can be automatically generated

3. If required, a developer can implement custom functionalities that may be required for your application  and not feasible on GO Platform. It can be connection to existing application and data, implementation of complex specific business rules etc.

4. You can iterate as many times as required to evolve your application over time, without losing your custom code and with automatic upgrade of your production databases.

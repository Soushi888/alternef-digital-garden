## What is Holochain?

Holochain is a revolutionary framework for building truly peer-to-peer applications, offering a post-blockchain approach to distributed computing. Unlike traditional blockchain technologies, Holochain provides a more scalable, flexible, and agent-centric model for decentralized systems.

## Core Principles

### Agent-Centric Design

- Puts human communication at the center of digital interaction
- Enables sovereign digital identity
- Breaks down monolithic application boundaries

### Decentralization

- Eliminates central points of control
- Supports direct, peer-to-peer interactions
- Ensures data integrity through distributed validation

### Interoperability

- Decouples application semantics from storage technologies
- Enables switching languages and storage layers seamlessly
- Provides a spanning layer above traditional network protocols

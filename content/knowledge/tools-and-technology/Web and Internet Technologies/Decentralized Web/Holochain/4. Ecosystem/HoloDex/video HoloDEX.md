In this video, Jamie Klinger and Adam Thompson discuss their journey exploring alternative economic systems and their involvement with Holochain. They touch on the disillusionment with traditional fiat systems after the 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent rise of cryptocurrencies. This led them to discover Holochain and the metacurrency project, which they saw as a logical evolution of mutual credit systems.

Jamie and Adam discuss their development of the Merit system, an alternative economic philosophy built on top of the metacurrency value flows. They also introduce HoloDEX, a currency exchange designed to bring convertibility into the Holochain ecosystem. They emphasize the importance of convertibility to ensure the success and scalability of mutual credit currencies and asset-backed alternatives.

The Holodex is a module of the Dex wallet and can be used as a smartphone or PC application. It allows users to run their own copy of the exchange from their device, making it more secure and private.

Each currency in the Holodex is a module that users can download and plug into their wallet. This allows users to customize their wallet to only include the currencies they want to trade. The Holodex also has an order book, similar to a centralized exchange.

A significant advantage of the Holodex is its ability to facilitate any-to-any currency trades without needing currency pairings. The exchange uses Dex as a transactional currency, along with an order matching algorithm, to enable seamless integration and trading of any currency with any other currency. This boosts liquidity and streamlines the trading process.

In the example given, users can value their currencies against Dex to automate the exchange of any currency to any other. The process of buying and selling Dex is automated and invisible to the user. This system allows for direct trades without having to go through an intermediate currency, increasing efficiency and reducing the steps involved in trading.

The holodex is a fractal exchange, meaning it can be cloned to create new markets for various assets, such as emissions, energy, water, or intellectual property. This can help fuel new industries by providing them with the necessary currency. A global view on the value of these assets can be created and traded on the holodex. This is possible due to a recent release of HoloChain, which enables the cloning of whole DNAs.

The speaker also envisions that most people will use the holodex headlessly, meaning they will not need to log into the exchange or manually fill out an order book to trade. Instead, they will rely on the spot price to convert one currency to another instantly. For example, if someone wants to pay for a purchase with Holo fuel, the holodex can instantly convert it to US dollars for the store owner. This instant conversion and settlement make the process seamless and easy to use.

Although some currencies may be more obscure and have less liquidity, as long as they are traded on the holodecks and have some liquidity, the exchange can still happen instantly. If there is no liquidity, there might be a delay in the conversion.

The fractal concept plays a role in the Holodex exchange, as well as how various assets like solar panels can be traded for a universal value of energy. The speaker also mentions that if someone has a preference for supporting certain types of carbon credits, they can do so by buying those credits on the emissions trading marketplace.

Furthermore, the speaker highlights the simplicity of creating new currencies and tokens within the Holodex system, and how the value of these tokens depends on their underlying utility or asset. Establishing trust between ledgers, such as between a bank ledger and the Holodex ledger, is crucial for easy transactions, especially with fiat currencies like USD.

The challenge of setting up trust relationships with blockchain smart contracts is also addressed, with the speaker noting that they believe they have found an elegant solution for the Trusted Oracle problem in Holochain. Lastly, they discuss hosting options for transactions and how users can either host their transactions themselves or outsource it to a service like Holo hosting.

Holodex can convert blockchain currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum into Holochain-native currencies that can be used throughout the Holochain ecosystem at a fraction of the cost. The speaker believes that as people realize the efficiency and utility of Holochain, they will opt not to return to blockchain-based currencies.

The Holodex Foundation aims to advance collective prosperity through justice, generosity, collaboration, and mutual assistance. The speaker acknowledges the staggering wealth that could flow into the foundation through transaction fees and emphasizes the importance of a constitution that constrains self-interest. The proposed model allocates 85% of the wealth to funding projects that create new currencies and asset-backed currencies, which in turn generate further wealth. A portion of the remaining funds is set aside for legal protection and maintenance of the exchange, as well as rewarding those who help establish and fund the Holodex.

The project is being built in collaboration with other projects and has received positive feedback from peers. The speaker also emphasizes the importance of establishing a proper legal framework for the project, especially as regulators are increasingly scrutinizing the crypto world. They are working with Stephen Alexander to create a new model of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that can operate in a legally compliant manner. The speaker states that the technical aspects of the project are complete, but the governance and legal framework need to be solidified before they can accept investments.

The conversation also touches on the concept of DAOs and their potential benefits, as well as the importance of having guiding principles for organizations. The speaker expresses interest in integrating ideas from Eric's "how project," which is a decentralized, semi-autonomous DAO that allows everyone to be involved in the decision-making process.

The conversation also briefly touches on the Merit system, which the speaker describes as a reconceptualization of economics based on human reality rather than the current man-made fiction. They compare this realization to the growing understanding of humanity's oneness. The conversation wraps up with appreciation for the opportunity to discuss these topics.

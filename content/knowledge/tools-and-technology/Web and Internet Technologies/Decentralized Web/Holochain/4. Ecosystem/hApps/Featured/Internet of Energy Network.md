The Internet of Energy Network (IOEN) is a [[Blockchain]]-based platform designed to promote clean energy by enabling connections and value flow between any energy device, user, and market. It provides an open protocol and standard for distributed accounting, transactions, and applications related to clean energy. 

The IOEN platform is built on [[Outils et Technologie/DWeb/Holochain/Holochain]] technology, which allows for a unique agent-based architecture that integrates with any energy device or user, facilitating scalable, private, and secure energy transactions. This system is not dependent on servers or global ledgers, making it well-suited for community and local energy system balancing and coordination. 

Additionally, it supports global value transfer via the IOEN Token, which is an [[ERC-20]] token used within the IOEN ecosystem. The platform was created by a team of twelve members, including co-founders Adams Bampus, Alex Evans, Simon Wilson, and Mike Gamble. IOEN aims to unlock a clean energy future by building energy networks from the ground up, device by device and user by user, fostering the capabilities of clean energy microgrids globally.

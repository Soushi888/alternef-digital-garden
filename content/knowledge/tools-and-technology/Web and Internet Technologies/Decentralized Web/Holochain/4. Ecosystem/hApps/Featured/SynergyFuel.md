Agents in the [[ADAM]] ecosystem are incentivized to actively participate in resolving and relaying queries through the use of SynergyFuel, a unique cryptocurrency designed for the ecosystem. Agents can pay other agents with SynergyFuel to relay and resolve their queries. SynergyFuel is implemented on Holochain as a mutual-credit, asset-backed currency, integrating a Prolog engine for result verification. By earning and utilizing SynergyFuel, users contribute to the network's health and collective intelligence, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem that benefits all participants.

## Holochain-based Mutual Credit Currency
SynergyFuel, as a  [[Mutual Currencies|mutual-credit, asset-backed currency]], operates on principles quite similar to those of [[HoloFuel]], another cryptocurrency built on the [[Outils et Technologie/DWeb/Holochain/Holochain]] framework.
HoloFuel and SynergyFuel are mutual-credit currencies that operate without a central authority issuing new currency
HoloFuel is tied to users' computational capacity, while SynergyFuel's value is tied to the network's capacity to resolve semantic queries effectively.

SynergyFuel incentivizes users to contribute to the network's collective intelligence by responding to and relaying queries
The mutual-credit currency design matches the needs of a real-world, non-corruptible, distributed, and growing ecosystem.

Holochain's mutual-credit currencies distribute power over currency units to users and allow for a fully distributed adjustment of the total supply based on the state of the network, such as the network's ability to respond to semantic queries

Coasys offers a contribution to the public’s capacity to sense-make as a
collective by providing the infrastructure for an open, interoperable web, a
collaboratively curated knowledge graph, as well as the tools to improve our
ability to find and share reliable information and coordinate effectively at any
scale or complexity. By doing so, it tries to approach the meta-crisis with
pragmatic technological upgrades to our society's digital communication
infrastructure.

More and more people recognise the fact that our civilisation’s ability to
find true statements about complex issues is surprisingly low and potentially
decreasing as systemic incentives promote the use of communication
primarily to shape opinions of others in order to advance personal, financial,
or political agendas. The advent of powerful AI through the recent
breakthroughs of LLMs will likely exacerbate this problem, as realistic looking
fake-news can be manufactured at low cost.

Decentralised cryptographic technologies give reason for hope since
cryptographic signatures introduce a base-layer of data integrity and
provenance. But for proper integrity management of complex semantic data,
more than just basic cryptography or blockchains are needed. With
[[Outils et Technologie/DWeb/Holochain/Holochain]]—a technology that enables complex data-integrity mechanisms—
distributed sense-making networks are now possible.

Over the last 3 years, the team behind Coasys has been building the
[[ADAM]] Layer, which extends Holochain’s agent-centric distributed software
architecture into a novel internet layer. The ADAM layer enables a new
interoperable web with social networking capacities where people have the
ability to share and collaborate on semantic graphs (called Perspectives),
independently of specific apps or base-layer technologies (like Holochain,
blockchains, or central databases). Alongside and on top of the ADAM layer,
the community platform [[Flux Social|Flux]] was built by the Coasys team which enabled us
to test, prove, and iterate the groundbreaking ideas in ADAM.

Now, Coasys turns the ADAM network (and each app built on ADAM) into
a [[Social Sensemaker|sense-making]] tool by tapping into the network’s collective intelligence. We
introduce [[SynergyFuel|Synergy Fuel]]: a Holochain-based mutual-credit currency backed by
the network's capacity to provide trustworthy information based on real
human connection and trust. This is a perfect application of ADAM’s
technology-independent semantic “Perspectives” and its concept of "[[Social DNA]]", as well as Holochain’s powerful, scalable and customisable validating
DHTs. With Coasys, users will be able to define simple or complex data
queries by describing the properties of the desired results with ADAM’s
Social DNA. We have successfully prototyped the use of LLMs for the
creation of Social DNA, which will provide users a simple way to create new
queries with complex rules. SynergyFuel’s main currency feature will be
vaults where users lock-in currency units as reward for providing a result to
their query. Using Holochain’s distributed validation mechanism, only
matching result-Perspectives will be able to unlock the provided funds in a
decentralised fashion. Included in these results will be the “social stack”, i.e.
the path the query took through the network of agents. Queries can define
what portions of the reward will be released for what role—that is, per hop
through the social graph, as well as for the agent who ultimately delivers the
result. Thus, SynergyFuel will be constructed as a currency coupled to, and
incentivising both, the relaying of queries of others to the agent’s trustnetwork, as well as responding with the sought after information.

The resulting system will be a fully decentralised search and synergy
engine for semantic data. Being built on top of the ADAM layer, which allows
existing Web 2.0 and Web3 platforms to be plugged in as data-storage layers
(wrapped as ADAM “Languages”), the synergy engine works with data stored
across all lower technology layers. ADAM Perspectives serve as semantic
overlay graphs that associate data stored across the internet in various
servers, blockchains, and Holochain DHTs. ADAM makes it possible to build
distributed, agent-centric apps on Holochain and other network technologies
which can have their unique value proposition completely independent from
Coasys and this semantic search engine. Users of these apps, being in full
control of their data, can choose to participate in these semantic searches by
offering specific data (or all of it) and use their data to earn SynergyFuel.

In order to sustain the development of the ADAM layer, Flux and other
ADAM apps, and to begin building Coasys and SynergyFuel within a nonprofit, open source context, we are conducting a pre-sale of SynergyFuel units. This document describes the underlying technological innovations, mainly the ADAM layer, the first apps built on ADAM, the mechanics of the query engine, the SynergyFuel currency, and the structure of the pre-sale.

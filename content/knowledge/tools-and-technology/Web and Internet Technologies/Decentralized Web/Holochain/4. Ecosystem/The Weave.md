The social fabric of complex and healthy societies is composed of many interlocking social agreements involving many community subsets.

We provide a grammar and implementation of a set of open protocols and standards for spinning up all kinds of small social agreement units and weaving them together in a meaningful and easy to use way.

The Weave:

- allows groups to embody their social context without any centralized infrastructure
- enables collaboration with fit-for-purpose group-ware _Tools_
- makes "own-your-data" real by design
- allows you to search all of your data across the groups you are part of
- grows with network-effects as _Tools_ are added to the ecosystem
- centers groups and their members, not large corporate silos

What we now call "The Web" was the result of three critical new open standards: HTML, HTTP and the URL. These allowed anybody to publish documents and link to them from other documents. The advent and Javascript and CSS made it so these documents were both beautiful and as functional as any computer program.

But none of those open standards enabled creation and management of _social context_ by groups. So, that critical function has become siloed into the big corporate websites: Facebook holds group's "Page", GitHub holds your code, GSuite holds your collaboration tools.

[[Outils et Technologie/DWeb/Holochain/Holochain]] is an open standard that delivers creating small functioning units of _social context_, in a way that is both scalable, and decentralized. To that we now add the **Weave Interaction Pattern**, an open standard for creating, searching, linking and organizing these _social context_ units into complex social fabric that yields "The Weave".

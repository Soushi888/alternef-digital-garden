The Social Sensemaker is the core of the [[Neighbourhoods]] framework. All modules placed in the low-code marketplace are compatible with it by default. Given the agent-centric nature of Holochain, everyone in a neighbourhood runs it on their device in order to compute on social data according to the designs of the neighbourhood(s) of which they are a part.

The social sensemaker also enables bridges between communities who recognize the meaning and value of each others’ cultural practices. Because it enables cross-neighbourhood recognition and insight about cultural computations, the social sensemaker and the neighbourhoods framework enable _meaningful_ data portability.

## Distributed Social Sense-making

Neighbourhoods and the Social Sensemaker massively reduce the social and financial costs of entering and exiting neighbourhoods for groups and individuals. Groups have the means to make decisions about new individuals and about other whole groups, while individuals find they need not constantly “start from scratch” accruing the benefits of recognition in each different space.

This capacity for distributed social sense-making involves both establishing data provenance through peer verification as well as leveraging multiple viewpoints to generate and distill insights about individuals and groups. The Social Sensemaker facilitates peer verification at many socially-relevant junctures.

An Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) is **the amount of digital currency that remains after a cryptocurrency transaction**. It is not a lower denomination of the currency, but a transaction output in the database generated by the network to allow for non-exact change transactions. 
UTXOs are used as the inputs of every [[Bitcoin]] transaction and can be used as an input in a later transaction. The UTXO model allows for the breaking up of cryptocurrency into fractional pieces.
Every crypto transaction consists of an input and an output, and any output that is left behind and is not spent immediately is an UTXO that can be later spent in a new transaction.

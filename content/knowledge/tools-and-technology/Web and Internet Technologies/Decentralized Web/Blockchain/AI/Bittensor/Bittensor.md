Bittensor is essentially a language for writing numerous decentralized commodity markets, or 'subnets', situated under a unified token system. These distinct markets function through Bittensor's [[Blockchain]], allowing each to interact and join into a singular computing infrastructure. By analogy, Bittensor brings the same type of abstraction which Ethereum added to Bitcoin for running decentralized contracts, but onto Bitcoin's inverse innovation — _digital markets_.

Understanding Bittensor is difficult for the exact same reason that it is powerful. This is because the majority of Bittensor's computational power is not concretely defined, but instead abstracted _underneath markets_. For instance, Bittensor leverages [[Machine Learning]] models to produce intelligence products, but Bittensor also leverages physical storage to create storage products. Meanwhile, it does _not define_ the specifics of how these resources are produced. Instead, Bittensor simply defines _the market_ which will reward those commodities for becoming available to the network.

## Consensus mechanism

The consensus mechanism of the Bittensor blockchain is a unique combination of deep learning and blockchain consensus algorithms. It is based on two main components: "[[Proof of Intelligence]]" and "[[Proof of Attention]]" (PoA) [1][2]. This innovative approach aims to reward nodes that contribute valuable machine-learning models and outputs to the network, making it a pioneering platform in the blockchain world[3]. The consensus mechanism enables the network to efficiently and scalably perform AI computations by integrating deep learning for complex tasks and blockchain consensus algorithms for trust, security, and decentralization[5].

The ChainGPT ecosystem incentivizes user participation and engagement through staking and farming options. Users can earn rewards and gain priority access to ChainGPT's features and products by staking CGPT tokens. Additionally, farming allows users to earn rewards by providing liquidity to supported exchanges' liquidity pools. The rewards earned are proportionate to the amount of CGPT tokens deposited into the pool. CGPT tokens play a vital role within the ChainGPT ecosystem, with fees charged for utilizing ChainGPT's products and tools paid in CGPT tokens. Half of these collected tokens are used to support the growth and maintenance of the ecosystem, while the other half is permanently burned, reducing the token supply over time and contributing to the value and scarcity of CGPT.

## Origins

Iagon was founded by a group of PhDs who identified the fundamental issues associated with how data is stored and used in the healthcare industry. Initially, the project focused on solving issues related to healthcare data storage, which lacked transparency for individuals. Over time, the scope expanded to revolutionize how data is stored, used, and owned across various industries.

## Token Utility

The Iagon token (IAG) is designed for use specifically on the Iagon cloud platform, facilitating payment for storage services. These services are priced against fiat currencies (e.g., USD or EUR), with an established exchange rate for IAG tokens, ensuring a stable utility value.

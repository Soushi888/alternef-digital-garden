Cardano PoolTool is a data analysis tool for the Cardano blockchain network that provides real-time and historical statistics on block production, staking rewards, and the health of the Cardano network[2][3]. It is a web-based platform that allows users to monitor the performance of Cardano stake pools, compare their performance, and make informed decisions on which pools to delegate their ADA tokens to[2][6]. The tool was created by a team of developers with the goal of providing useful tools and up-to-date information on Cardano, including staking, in-depth research, and exclusive offers from stake pool operators[2]. The platform is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to both novice and experienced users[6]. Cardano PoolTool is one of the most popular pool explorers in the Cardano community and is widely used by Cardano stakeholders and pool operators[4][5].

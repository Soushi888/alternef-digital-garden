The [[Ergo]] Rosen Bridge differs from other cross-chain solutions in a few ways. Firstly, it is an Ergo-centric bridge, meaning it is fully decentralized and minimizes the attack vector of the bridge because there is no need to worry about the security assumptions of the other [[Blockchain]] [1][5]. Secondly, it removes the need to interact with smart contracts on the other chain, which is one of the key innovations that sets Rosen apart from other bridges[5]. Additionally, it is a 2nd layer authentication bridge, meaning there are two layers of security in the form of watchers and guards[5]. Finally, the Rosen Bridge relies only on Ergo's smart contract capabilities, and no smart contracts are used on the other chain, which is unique in the industry and lowers the attack surface[5].

> The Nervos Network is a flexible blockchain platform, secured by proof of work, which allows developers freedom of choice in cryptographic primitives and decentralized application architecture.

The Nervos Network is a blockchain platform that consists of multiple blockchain layers designed for different functions. The foundational layer is known as the Common Knowledge Base (CKB), which is built for modularity, security, and interoperability. It is a flexible and interoperable Layer 1 blockchain that prioritizes security and decentralization as core design principles. The Nervos blockchain offers a novel tokenomic model, supports all cryptographic primitives, and can seamlessly interoperate with heterogeneous blockchains and anchor various sidechains, state channels, and Layer 2 networks. The platform aims to create a peer-to-peer crypto-economy network where users can access a wide range of provably secure blockchain services and capabilities[1][3][4][5].

## Blockchain Technology: Foundations of Decentralized Systems

Blockchain is a revolutionary distributed ledger technology that enables secure, transparent, and decentralized record-keeping across various domains.

## Core Consensus Mechanisms

### 1. Proof of Work (PoW)

- First blockchain consensus mechanism
- High computational complexity
- Examples: Bitcoin, early blockchain networks

### 2. Proof of Stake (PoS)

- Energy-efficient alternative to PoW
- Validators stake cryptocurrency
- Examples: [[Cardano]], Ethereum 2.0

### 3. Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)

- Representative democracy model
- Elected validators process transactions
- Examples: [[Bitshares]], Hive

## Key Technologies

### Smart Contracts

- Self-executing contracts with predefined rules
- Enables complex decentralized applications
- Platforms:
  - [[Ethereum Virtual Machine|EVM]]
  - [[Antelope SDK]]
  - [[Substrate]]

### Stable Coins

- Cryptocurrencies with stable value
- Mechanisms to maintain price consistency
- Use cases in DeFi and global transactions

## Related Concepts

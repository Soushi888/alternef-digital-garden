Digital Permaculture applies the core principles of permaculture to the design and development of digital systems and web technologies. It emphasizes creating sustainable, resilient, and regenerative digital ecosystems.

## Core Principles

1. **Observe and Interact**: Study existing digital systems and user behaviors before implementing solutions
2. **Catch and Store Energy**: Efficient resource usage and data storage
3. **Obtain a Yield**: Create value-generating systems that benefit all participants
4. **Self-Regulation**: Implement feedback mechanisms and governance structures
5. **Use and Value Renewable Resources**: Prioritize sustainable computing and green technologies

## Applications in Web3

Digital Permaculture principles align naturally with Web3 technologies:

- Decentralized systems that distribute power and responsibility
- Token economics that incentivize sustainable behaviors
- Community-driven governance models
- Regenerative economic systems
- Resilient network architectures

Ceramic Network is a decentralized data network that powers an ecosystem of interoperable [[Web 3|Web3]] applications and services. It provides a protocol for decentralized event streaming and serves as the decentralized data layer for the Ceramic ecosystem. The Ceramic network provides core services to the Dataverse, including API hosting, event storage, event ordering, and networking. The network is based on a scalable decentralized network that distributes, shares, and delivers events. The Ceramic protocol is implemented in [[TypeScript]] and is available on [[GitHub]]. The project is currently in the Claytestnet phase, which is a decentralized public network ready for experimental application development and testing. The network anchors documents on the [[Ethereum]] Ropsten and Rinkeby testnets. The Ceramic network is a product of the Heltec team and is not related to Ceramic Arts Network, which is a separate organization for ceramic artists.

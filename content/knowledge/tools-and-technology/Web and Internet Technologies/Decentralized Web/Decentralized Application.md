A Decentralized Application (DApp) is a type of application that runs on a decentralized network, rather than a centralized server. DApps are built on [[Blockchain]] technology, which allows them to operate without the need for a central authority. This decentralization means that the application's data and operations are distributed across a network of computers, making it resistant to censorship, downtime, fraud, and third-party interference.

DApps can be built on various blockchain platforms, with Ethereum being one of the most popular due to its support for smart contracts. These applications can range from simple games to complex decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and more. They leverage blockchain technology to provide a secure, transparent, and immutable record of transactions, ensuring that once a transaction is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted.

One of the key features of DApps is their use of smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. Smart contracts automatically enforce and execute the terms of a contract when predetermined conditions are met, without the need for a centralized authority. This eliminates the need for intermediaries, reducing costs and increasing efficiency.

However, another approach to building dApps exists outside the traditional blockchain model. [[Outils et Technologie/DWeb/Holochain/Holochain]] offers a framework for developing decentralized applications that emphasizes scalability, data sovereignty, and energy efficiency. Unlike blockchain-based dApps, Holochain uses a distributed hash table (DHT) for data storage and validation through a network of nodes, where each node maintains its own private forkable source chain. This architecture allows Holochain to handle a large volume of transactions without the bottlenecks associated with blockchain's consensus mechanisms. Holochain's agent-centric design gives users control over their own data and identity, contrasting with the account-based models common in blockchain platforms.

DApps are designed to operate in a decentralized manner, meaning they are not controlled by any single entity. Instead, they are governed by the rules encoded in the blockchain or the distributed hash table, and the consensus of the network participants. This decentralization ensures that DApps are resistant to censorship and control by any single party, making them a powerful tool for creating applications that are transparent, secure, and resistant to manipulation.

In summary, Decentralized Applications represent a new generation of applications leveraging both blockchain technology and innovative frameworks like Holochain to provide decentralized, transparent, and secure platforms for a wide range of applications, from finance to gaming, without the need for a centralized authority.

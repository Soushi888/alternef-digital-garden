The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric block cipher chosen by the U.S. government to protect classified information. It encrypts sensitive data by putting it through multiple encryption rounds and splitting a message into smaller blocks of 128 bits. AES uses the same key for both encryption and decryption, distinguishing it from [[Asymmetric encryption]] algorithms that use different keys for these processes. It supports various key lengths (128, 192, or 256 bits), providing strong protection against unauthorized access. AES is widely implemented in software and hardware globally for securing internet communication, protecting sensitive data, and encrypting files. It became the default encryption algorithm for protecting classified information in June 2003 and is recognized globally for its ability to keep information safe from cyber threats.
## Key Points

- **Symmetric Block Cipher**: AES encrypts data by splitting it into blocks and applying encryption rounds to each block using the same key for both encryption and decryption.
- **Key Lengths**: Supports 128, 192, or 256 bits key lengths, with longer keys providing stronger security but requiring more processing power.
- **Wide Adoption**: Used globally in various applications including government computer security, cybersecurity, electronic data protection, storage media encryption, electronic communication apps, programming libraries, internet browsers, wireless networks, databases, login credentials, and virtual private networking (VPN).
- **Standardization**: Developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), AES is included in the ISO/IEC 18033-3 standard and was approved by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) for protecting top-secret information.

## Example Usage

AES is used across a broad spectrum of applications due to its robustness and efficiency. Here are some common use cases:

- **Data Storage**: Encrypting data stored on hard drives, USB drives, and other storage media to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Secure Communication**: Protecting data transmitted over the internet, such as emails, instant messaging, and video calls.
- **Software Development**: Implementing AES in programming libraries for application-level encryption needs.
- **Network Security**: Securing wireless networks and VPN connections to safeguard data in transit.

## Conclusion

AES stands out as a critical component of modern cryptography, offering a balance between security and performance. Its widespread adoption and recognition by international standards bodies underscore its effectiveness in securing digital information against unauthorized access.

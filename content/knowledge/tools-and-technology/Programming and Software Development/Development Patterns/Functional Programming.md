## Functional Programming (FP): A Paradigm of Pure Functions

Functional Programming (FP) is a declarative programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions while avoiding state changes and side effects. It focuses on immutability, pure functions, and function composition, making programs more predictable and easier to reason about.

## 1. Key Principles of Functional Programming

### Pure Functions

A pure function:

- Always returns the same output for the same input.
- Has no side effects (does not modify variables, files, databases, etc.).

#### Example (Pure Function in Haskell & JavaScript)

```haskell
add :: Int -> Int -> Int
add x y = x + y
```

```js
const add = (x, y) => x + y;
```

- This function is pure because it always returns `x + y` without modifying any external state.

---

### Immutability

- Data is never modified, instead, new values are returned.
- This eliminates bugs from unexpected state changes.

#### Example (Immutable vs. Mutable)

```haskell
-- Haskell (Immutable)
doubleList :: [Int] -> [Int]
doubleList xs = map (*2) xs
```

```js
// JavaScript (Mutable)
let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers.push(4);  // Mutates the array

// JavaScript (Immutable)
const newNumbers = [...numbers, 4];  // Creates a new array instead
```

- Mutable state can cause unpredictable bugs, while immutability makes programs safer.

---

### Higher-Order Functions

- Functions can take other functions as arguments or return functions.
- Enables powerful function composition.

#### Example: Map Function (Applying a Function to Each Element of a List)

```haskell
-- Haskell
doubleNumbers :: [Int] -> [Int]
doubleNumbers xs = map (*2) xs
```

```js
// JavaScript
const doubleNumbers = (arr) => arr.map(x => x * 2);
```

---

### Function Composition

- Small functions are combined to build more complex logic.
- Instead of using nested function calls, FP uses chaining or composition.

#### Example (Composing Functions in Haskell)

```haskell
import Data.Char (toUpper)

capitalize :: String -> String
capitalize = map toUpper

exclaim :: String -> String
exclaim = (++ "!")

shout :: String -> String
shout = exclaim . capitalize  -- Composition

main = putStrLn (shout "hello")  -- Outputs: "HELLO!"
```

---

### Recursion Instead of Loops

- Loops modify state (mutable variables).
- Recursion is preferred in FP to avoid state mutation.

#### Example (Factorial Using Recursion)

```haskell
factorial :: Int -> Int
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)
```

---

### Lazy Evaluation

- Expressions are not evaluated until they are needed, improving efficiency.
- Example: Infinite Lists in Haskell work due to laziness!

```haskell
numbers = [1..]  -- Infinite list of numbers!
take 10 numbers  -- Takes only the first 10 numbers
```

## 2. Imperative vs. Functional Programming

| Feature | Functional Programming | Imperative Programming |
|---------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **State** | Immutable | Mutable |
| **Functions** | Pure, without side effects | Functions modify state |
| **Control Flow** | Recursion, function composition | Loops, conditionals |
| **Code Structure** | Declarative (what to do) | Imperative (how to do) |
| **Concurrency** | Easier due to immutability | Harder due to shared state |

---

## 3. Languages That Support Functional Programming

### Pure Functional Languages

- **Haskell**, **Elm**, **Idris**, **Futhark**

### Multi-Paradigm Languages (Functional + Imperative/OOP)

- **JavaScript (ES6+)** â†’ Functional methods (`map`, `reduce`, `filter`)  
- **Scala** â†’ Combines FP with OOP  
- **Rust** â†’ Strong support for FP with immutability  
- **Python** â†’ Supports functional constructs  
- **Clojure** â†’ Lisp-based FP language  

---

## 4. Benefits of Functional Programming

- **Predictability** â€“ No unexpected side effects  
- **Easier Debugging** â€“ Pure functions are easier to test  
- **Better Concurrency** â€“ No shared mutable state  
- **Reusable & Composable Code** â€“ Encourages small, reusable functions  
- **Mathematical Foundation** â€“ Easier to verify correctness  

---

## 5. Downsides of Functional Programming

- **Performance Overhead** â€“ Due to immutability and recursion  
- **Learning Curve** â€“ Especially with concepts like Monads in Haskell  
- **Not Always Practical** â€“ Some problems are easier in imperative style  

---

## 6. Functional Programming in Practice

- **Web Development** â†’ React (with Hooks & functional components)  
- **Data Processing** â†’ Functional paradigms in Python (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`)  
- **Finance & Blockchain** â†’ Haskell used in Cardano's **Plutus** smart contracts  
- **Concurrency & Parallelism** â†’ FP languages excel in **multi-core computing**

## Conclusion

Functional Programming is a powerful paradigm that promotes pure functions, immutability, and composability. While it has a steeper learning curve, it offers safer, more reliable, and concurrent-friendly software development.

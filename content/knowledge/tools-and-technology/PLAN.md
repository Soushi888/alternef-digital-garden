## 1. Language Standardization

- Convert all directory and file names to English
- Implement translations later using Quartz internationalization
- Current translations needed:
  - "Bases de Données" → "Databases"
  - "Intelligence Artificielle" → "Artificial Intelligence"
  - "Programmation" → "Programming"

## 2. Directory Structure Optimization

   - Game Development
     - Unity
     - Game Engines
     - Graphics Programming

5. Tools and Platforms:
   - Development Tools
     - IDEs and Editors
     - Version Control Tools
     - Development Environments

   - Content Management
     - Wiki Systems
     - Documentation Tools
     - Digital Gardens

   - Low Code Platforms
     - Visual Development
     - Automation Tools

## 3. Content Standards

### Metadata Requirements

Every markdown file must include:

```yaml
---
title: [Descriptive title]
description: [Clear, concise description of the content]
tags: [Relevant root-level tags]
---

```

### Index Files (index.md)

Each directory should have an index.md file containing:

1. Overview of the topic area
2. Key concepts and terminology
3. Relationships to other topics
4. No direct children listing (handled by Quartz folder feature)

### Tag Strategy

- Use root-level tags only (no hierarchical tags)
- Core technical tags:
  - programming
  - infrastructure
  - networking
  - security
  - web
  - blockchain
  - holochain
  - ai
  - data
  - tools
  - distributed-systems
  - cryptography
  - authentication
  - protocols
  - development
  - documentation

- Content type tags:
  - concept
  - tutorial
  - reference
  - guide
  - theory
  - implementation
  - comparison
  - case-study

## 4. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Structure and Language Preparation

- [ ] Create new directory structure
  - [ ] Programming and Software Development
  - [ ] Infrastructure and Networks
  - [ ] Data and Storage
  - [ ] Web and Internet Technologies
  - [ ] Security and Privacy
  - [ ] Specialized Technologies
  - [ ] Tools and Platforms

- [ ] Rename existing directories to English
  - [x] "Bases de Données" → "Databases"
  - [ ] "Intelligence Artificielle" → "Artificial Intelligence"
  - [x] "Programmation" → "Programming"
  - [ ] Verify all directory names are in English

- [ ] Create index.md files for each new directory
  - [ ] Write overview
  - [ ] List key concepts
  - [ ] Add relationships to other topics

### Phase 2: Content Migration

- [ ] Audit existing content
  - [ ] Map current files to new structure
  - [ ] Identify orphaned or misplaced content
  - [ ] Create migration spreadsheet

- [ ] Migrate content
  - [ ] DWeb/Blockchain content
  - [ ] Networking and Distributed Systems
  - [ ] Programming Languages and Paradigms
  - [ ] Security and Cryptography content
  - [ ] AI and Machine Learning files

- [ ] Update internal links
  - [ ] Use Obsidian link checker
  - [ ] Verify all [[wikilinks]] are correct
  - [ ] Update to use new directory structure

### Phase 3: Metadata and Tagging

- [ ] Standardize metadata
  - [ ] Add `title` to all files
  - [ ] Add `description` to all files
  - [ ] Implement root-level tags
  - [ ] Remove hierarchical tags

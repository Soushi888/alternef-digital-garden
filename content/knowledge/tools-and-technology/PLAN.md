## 1. Language Standardization

- [x] Convert all directory and file names to English
- [ ] Implement translations later using Quartz internationalization
- Current translations completed:
  - [x] "Bases de Données" → "Databases"

## 3. Content Standards

### Metadata Requirements

Every markdown file must include:

```yaml
---
title: [Descriptive title]
description: [Clear, concise description of the content]
tags: [Relevant root-level tags]
---

```

### Index Files (index.md)

Each directory should have an index.md file containing:

1. Overview of the topic area
2. Key concepts and terminology
3. Relationships to other topics
4. No direct children listing (handled by Quartz folder feature)

### Tag Strategy

- Use root-level tags only (no hierarchical tags)
- Core technical tags:
  - programming
  - infrastructure
  - networking
  - security
  - web
  - blockchain
  - holochain
  - ai
  - data
  - tools
  - distributed-systems
  - cryptography
  - authentication
  - protocols
  - development
  - documentation

- Content type tags:
  - concept
  - tutorial
  - reference
  - guide
  - theory
  - implementation
  - comparison
  - case-study

## 4. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Structure and Language Preparation

- [x] Create new directory structure
  - [x] Programming and Software Development
  - [x] Infrastructure and Networks
  - [x] Data and Storage
  - [x] Web and Internet Technologies
  - [x] Security and Privacy
  - [x] Specialized Technologies
  - [x] Tools and Platforms

- [x] Rename existing directories to English
  - [x] "Bases de Données" → "Databases"
  - [x] "Intelligence Artificielle" → "Artificial Intelligence"
  - [x] "Programmation" → "Programming"
  - [x] Verify all directory names are in English

- [x] Create index.md files for each new directory
  - [x] Write overview
  - [x] List key concepts
  - [x] Add relationships to other topics

### Phase 2: Content Migration

- [x] Audit existing content
  - [x] Map current files to new structure
  - [x] Identify orphaned or misplaced content
  - [x] Create migration spreadsheet

- [x] Migrate content
  - [x] DWeb/Blockchain content
  - [x] Networking and Distributed Systems
  - [x] Programming Languages and Paradigms
  - [x] Security and Cryptography content
  - [x] AI and Machine Learning files
  - [x] Programmation directory content
    - [x] Migrate Authentication-related files
    - [x] Migrate API documentation
    - [x] Migrate development tools
    - [x] Migrate protocols and communication files

- [x] Update internal links
  - [x] Update Axium.md file metadata and location
  - [x] Migrate files from Programmation directory
  - [ ] Update links in other files

- [ ] Standardize metadata

  - [ ] Update remaining internal wiki-style links
  - [ ] Verify all links are working
- Finish metadata standardization
  - [x] Add `title` and `description` to library files
  - [ ] Add `title` and `description` to remaining files
  - [ ] Update tags to follow new convention
  - [ ] Remove hierarchical tags
- Review and verify content integrity
- Implement comprehensive tagging strategy
- Perform final cross-linking audit

IEML (Information Economy Meta-Language) is an open-source artificial method designed to represent the semantic content of linguistic signs in a computer-readable way. It was developed by Pierre Lévy as part of his work on collective intelligence, aiming to encode meaning in a way that is inspired by the structure of natural languages but also grounded in mathematics and logic abstractions.

The core goal of IEML is to make real-world data machine-readable by proposing a standard representation that enables the mapping of semantic representations with data in a computer-friendly manner. IEML's design starts with a small set of primary concepts arranged in a matrix, which are then composed together to create more complex concepts. This process can be repeated, allowing for the creation of increasingly complex concepts through a matrix and fractal design. This design makes the representation easy to manipulate, quick to calculate distances between concepts, and simple to encode.

IEML is related to [[Semantic AI]] in that it serves as a foundation for semantic computation and semantic interoperability between systems. It is part of a neuro-symbolic architecture, specifically a neuro-semantic architecture, which emphasizes solving the problem of semantic computation. IEML facilitates the categorization of training data (text, image, sound, etc.) into various types of [[Neural Network|neural networks]], which then input information into the system. This categorized data is transmitted to a semantic knowledge base, which is organized by a semantic network and supported by a graph database. The knowledge base can be presented as a hypertextual encyclopedia, allowing for the programming of simulations and various dashboards for monitoring and intelligence.

IEML is intended for use across multiple disciplines, including [[Artificial Intelligence]], business intelligence, data science, heritage conservation, digital humanities, and digital communications. It addresses the problem of semantic interoperability among databases, languages, and disciplines, offering a powerful symbolic tool for these fields. IEML's semantics are unambiguous and computable, aligning with its syntax, making it a well-formed symbolic system. This property allows IEML to serve as a concept coding system that lays the foundations for a new generation of artificial intelligence and enables collective intelligence to be reflexive. IEML provides a coordinate system for a common knowledge base that feeds both automatic reasoning and statistical calculations, fulfilling the promise of the Semantic Web through its computable meaning and interoperable ontologies.

In summary, IEML is a language with computable semantics that is designed to facilitate semantic computation and interoperability in artificial intelligence systems. It is a tool that bridges the gap between natural language and machine-readable data, enabling more sophisticated and coherent models of knowledge and enhancing the capabilities of AI systems in understanding and generating human language.

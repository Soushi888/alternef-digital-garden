## 3. Documentation Standards

### Metadata Requirements

Every markdown file must include:

```yaml
---
title: [Descriptive title]
description: [Clear, concise description of the content]
tags: [Relevant root-level tags]
---

```

### Index Files (index.md)

Each directory should have an index.md file containing:

1. Overview of the topic area
2. Key concepts and terminology
3. Relationships to other topics
4. No direct children listing (handled by Quartz folder feature)

### Tag Strategy

- Use root-level tags only (no hierarchical tags)
- Core technical tags:
  - programming
  - infrastructure
  - networking
  - security
  - web
  - blockchain
  - holochain
  - ai
  - data
  - tools
  - distributed-systems
  - cryptography
  - authentication
  - protocols
  - development
  - documentation

- Content type tags:
  - concept
  - tutorial
  - reference
  - guide
  - theory
  - implementation
  - comparison
  - case-study

### Note Metadata Structure

```markdown
---
title: [Clear, descriptive title]
description: [Concise summary of the note's content]
aliases: 
tags: 
  - [relevant tags in kebab-case]
related pages:
  - "[[Related Page]]"
---
```

### Content Organization

- Use ## for main section headings
- Use ### for subsections
- Start with a clear, concise introduction
- Use bullet points for key information
- Include citations and references
- Use wikilinks `[[page-name|Page Name]]` for internal links

### Naming Conventions

- Filenames: lowercase with hyphens
- Placement: Logical directory structure
- Tags: Use kebab-case
- Ensure descriptive, meaningful names

### Tagging Guidelines

- Use consistent, meaningful tags
- Prioritize clarity and discoverability
- Tags should help with navigation and categorization

### Best Practices

- Maintain consistent tone and style
- Focus on readability
- Regularly update and refactor notes
- Ensure notes are self-contained yet interconnected

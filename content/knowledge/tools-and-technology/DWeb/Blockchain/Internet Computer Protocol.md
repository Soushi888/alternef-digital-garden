The Internet Computer is a blockchain project developed by the DFINITY Foundation. It aims to create a decentralized internet where software can be built and run with the same capabilities as traditional web services, but with the added benefits of blockchain technology. The Internet Computer extends the functionality of the public internet so that it can host software, making next-generation dapps and open internet services possible. It is powered by machines in data centers across the world that communicate through the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) [source](https://medium.com/dfinity/achieving-consensus-on-the-internet-computer-ee9fbfbafcbc#fd10).

The Internet Computer uses a novel consensus protocol to maintain a coherent state across its network. This protocol ensures that all nodes in a subnet process the same messages in the same order. The consensus protocol achieves this by creating a chain of blocks containing the inputs and handing over the content to the message routing layer, which ensures that the inputs reach their targets. The protocol relies on an unbiased and unpredictable pseudorandom function to determine which node is supposed to create the next block [source](https://internetcomputer.org/blog/features/node-metrics#how-consensus-has-always-worked).

A unique aspect of the Internet Computer's consensus protocol is that it provides cryptographically guaranteed finality, which is different from other consensus protocols, such as the one used by Bitcoin, which provides probabilistic finality [source](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/tutorials/developer-journey/level-0/ic-overview#consensus).

The consensus algorithm of the Internet Computer uses a voting mechanism that does not waste power on computing hashes of artificial difficulties, making it more energy-efficient than Proof-of-Work-based blockchains [source](https://support.dfinity.org/hc/en-us/articles/4417926836372-Is-there-anything-the-Internet-Computer-Protocol-is-doing-or-anything-about-the-technology-that-makes-it-an-environmentally-sustainable-option).

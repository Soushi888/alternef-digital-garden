Scalable & distributed  framework for economic  network coordination

Hollistic supply chain.

hREA ([[Outils et Technologie/DWeb/Holochain/Holochain]] [[Resource-Event-Agent]]) is a scalable and distributed framework designed for economic network coordination. It is an implementation of the [[ValueFlows]] specification, enabling a transparent and trusted account of resource and information flows between decentralized and independent agents across and within ecosystems.

hREA is particularly useful for organizations and businesses with cross-stakeholder value chains, such as supply chains, joint ventures, multi-company collaboration spaces, cooperative and small business economic networks, and more. It also supports parties involved in loosely coupled economic coordination, including open-source projects, artistic collectives, eco villages, makerspaces, mutual credit & mutual aid networks, open value networks, DAOs, and more.

Holochain serves as the backbone of hREA, facilitating network processes, data storage, and data validation. hREA implements an abstraction over Holochain's API layer, using a client-side [[GraphQL]] Client that matches the ValueFlows GraphQL specification. This approach allows developers to access Holochain without needing to learn the Rust language, making it accessible to a wider audience.

hREA is built on the principles of the Resources, Events, and Agents (REA) economic vocabulary, which is based on a quiet innovative accounting standard. It allows for the tracking and tracing of value flows in conventional and alternative economies, breaking down silos around people, organizations, and locations, and tracking multiple forms of value as they flow through exchanges, regions, and production processes.

In summary, hREA, leveraging Holochain and ValueFlows, provides a powerful toolkit for building economic and financial applications that offer a zoomed-out view of the economy, enabling a more integrated and innovative approach to providing for human needs within the current system. It focuses on optimizing resource use with an aspiration of living in harmony with nature, by situating economic activities in a network view and tracking various forms of value.

A core feature of Moss is the the ability for groups to pick the fit-for-purpose tooling that's appropriate for each group, and, as desired add specific new tools as the group's purpose and needs evolve.

Assets generated in one Tool can be linked to and embedded in Assets created by other tools. This creates an "asset-centric" computing environment rather than the usual application centric model.

Here are a number of Tools that have already been developed that you can use in your groups:

- **Vines:** Provides the usual chat functionality: topics, channels, attachments, mentions, etc.

- **Slate:** Provides real-time collaborative drawing. Fully featured diagrams and drawing tools based on the [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) open-source library.

- **Notebooks:** Provides real-time collaborative editing of MarkDown documents. Includes syntax-highlighting, version history, and more.

- **KanDo:** provides robust KanBan functionality with commenting, assignments, labels, categories, checklists and more.

- **Presence:** provides video conferencing with screen sharing

- **TalkingStickies:** provides real-time stickies-boards for ideation, meeting agendas, retros, etc...

- **Converge:** allows stakeholders to shift focus from outcomes to refining a set of criteria that has maximal support. Using this list, they can evaluate and refine proposals to meet those broadly supported criteria.

- **Who's In?:** enables users to propose collective actions or events. With it, anyone can suggest a joint action or event, which other people can agree to on the contingency that every necessary role is filled. This allows group action to grow effortlessly from idea to reality without anyone having to worry about its viability

- **SnapMail:** provides email-like in-group messaging with attachments, replies, etc.

- **Where:** provides a generalized grammar for creating shared maps for groups to see the emergent "whereness" of each other across those them, as well as the grammatics to self-evolved these spaces and how to represent "location" in them.

- **Gamez:** provides a place to design and play arbitrary board games.

- **WaterTable:** provides ability to create database-like tables for collecting and viewing data. Think of this as an "AirTable" clone!

- **Xylem:** provides real-time collaborative spread-sheets based on the [Univer](https://github.com/dream-num/univer) open-source library.

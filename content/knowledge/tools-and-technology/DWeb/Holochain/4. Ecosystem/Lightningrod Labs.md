### [[Where]]

A playground for group self-awareness (awhereness?) on Holochain

Groups, especially remote colaborative groups, often lack contextual information about collaborators that makes working together harder. Co-locating oneself across a number of spaces in the context of a group (or groups) provides an important avenue for improving both sense-making and working together. Where provides a generalized grammar for creating shared maps for groups to see the emergent "whereness" of each other across those them, as well as the grammatics to self-evolved these spaces and how to represent "location" in them.

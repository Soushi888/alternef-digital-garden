## What is Neighbourhoods?

[Neighbourhoods](https://neighbourhoods.network) is a project building tools and services for a new framework for creating and organizing online communities.

Neighbourhoods makes it easy to bundle together different “groupware” modules and to pair these with tags, reactions, ratings, and reputation systems chosen to fit your group’s culture and purpose

## Portable, Contextual, Interpersonal Data

_Therefore, using neighbourhoods, one can:_

-   ask the original creator of a score to re-compute it

-   ask other agents with visibility into the Neighbourhood(s) to execute the same computation

-   compare computation results of many actors' subjective viewpoints in order to reason about a shared truth in a nuanced way

-   verify computations made by others using one's own visibility into a Neighbourhood.


## Reputation Language (rep_lang)

rep_lang is a custom-built language for reaction and reputation data. It aims to provide an extensible framework for Neighbourhoods to specify "types" of responses and event records which are important to them, define functions over those types, and instantiate data values of those types. rep_lang makes "shared computation" seamless and facilitates easy sharing and remixing of these types, functions, and data definitions between agents and communities. By doing so, it will support the translation of social sensemaking metrics from one context to another.

The language is written in Rust for easy interoperation with Holochain, though is architected in a modular way (in the spirit of Neighbourhoods) such that it can be deployed in other contexts or on other tech stacks.

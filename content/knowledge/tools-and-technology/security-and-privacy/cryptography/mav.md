The Minimum Attack Vector (MAV) is a metric that measures the level of decentralization in the mining of a blockchain.
It is similar to the Nakamoto coefficient, which measures the level of decentralization in the production of blocks.
The MAV is the minimum number of independent parties needed to join together for a successful attack on the blockchain.
The higher the MAV, the more decentralized the network is considered to be.
Cardano's MAV has been increasing over time, indicating that the network is becoming more decentralized.
As of May 2023, [[Cardano]]'s MAV was 36
In comparison, [[Ethereum]]'s MAV was 3 in December 2022.
According to crypto researcher Sooraj, the Cardano networking layer might be found to be eight times more decentralized than the networking layer of Ethereum.

Huginn AI is a system for building agents that perform automated tasks for you online. These agents can read the web, watch for events, and take actions on your behalf. Huginn's Agents create and consume events, propagating them along a directed graph. Think of it as a hackable version of IFTTT (If This Then That) or Zapier on your own server.

In essence, Huginn AI enables users to create custom automation workflows by designing agents that can:

1. Monitor specific data sources (e.g., web pages, APIs, databases)
2. Trigger actions based on predefined conditions or events
3. Perform tasks, such as sending notifications, updating databases, or executing scripts

Huginn AI is a general-purpose model, capable of maintaining a broad range of knowledge, performing logical thought, and accurately following instructions. This makes it suitable for various applications, including:

 - Roleplays
 - Chatbots or assistants
* Automation workflows

The system is designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing users to create complex automation scenarios by combining multiple agents and events. Huginn AI's architecture is based on Bayesian networks, which provide a robust and scalable foundation for its decision-making capabilities.

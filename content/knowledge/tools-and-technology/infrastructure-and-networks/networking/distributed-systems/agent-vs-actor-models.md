# Agent vs Actor Models

While often confused or used interchangeably, Agent and Actor models represent distinct approaches to building distributed, concurrent systems. Understanding their differences is crucial for choosing the right computational model for specific applications. This comparison explores their origins, characteristics, and practical implications.

## Conceptual Origins

### Actor Model
- **Origin**: Mathematical model of concurrent computation (Carl Hewitt, 1973)
- **Foundation**: Formal mathematical framework for concurrent systems
- **Focus**: Pure computation and message-passing concurrency
- **Scope**: Low-level computational primitives

### Agent Model
- **Origin**: Artificial Intelligence and distributed problem-solving (1980s-1990s)
- **Foundation**: Autonomous entities with goals and behaviors
- **Focus**: Intelligence, autonomy, and goal-directed behavior
- **Scope**: High-level behavioral abstractions

## Core Characteristics Comparison

| Aspect | [[actor-model\|Actor Model]] | Agent Model |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Primary Focus** | Concurrent computation | Autonomous behavior |
| **State Management** | Encapsulated state | Belief/knowledge state |
| **Communication** | Asynchronous messages | Communication + negotiation |
| **Intelligence** | Reactive processing | Proactive goal-seeking |
| **Coordination** | Message passing only | Coordination protocols |
| **Decision Making** | Simple message handling | Complex reasoning |

## Detailed Comparison

### Computational Model

#### Actors
- **Pure computational units**: Process messages, create actors, send messages
- **Stateless operations**: Each message handled independently
- **Location transparency**: Actors can be anywhere in network
- **Fault isolation**: [[supervision-tree|Supervision trees]] for error recovery

#### Agents  
- **Autonomous entities**: Have goals, beliefs, desires, intentions
- **Stateful behavior**: Maintain knowledge bases and learning history
- **Environment awareness**: Perceive and act upon their environment
- **Social intelligence**: Negotiate, cooperate, compete with other agents

### Communication Patterns

#### Actor Communication
```
Actor A → [Message] → Actor B
- Fire-and-forget messaging
- No guaranteed response
- Pattern matching on message types
- Location-transparent addressing
```

#### Agent Communication
```
Agent A ⇄ [Negotiation Protocol] ⇄ Agent B
- Speech acts and ontologies  
- Contract negotiation
- Auction mechanisms
- Shared understanding protocols
```

### Intelligence and Autonomy

#### Actors (Low Intelligence)
- **Reactive**: Respond to incoming messages
- **Deterministic**: Same input → same output
- **No goals**: Process messages as they arrive
- **Simple state machines**: Basic behavioral patterns

#### Agents (High Intelligence)
- **Proactive**: Take initiative to achieve goals
- **Adaptive**: Learn from experience and environment
- **Goal-oriented**: Work toward objectives
- **Complex reasoning**: Plan, learn, adapt strategies

### Coordination Mechanisms

#### Actor Coordination
- **Supervisor hierarchies**: [[supervision-tree|Supervision trees]]
- **Message routing**: Direct point-to-point communication
- **Event streams**: Publisher-subscriber patterns
- **No global coordination**: Emergent system behavior

#### Agent Coordination
- **Multi-agent systems (MAS)**: Coordinated group behavior
- **Contract nets**: Distributed task allocation
- **Blackboard systems**: Shared knowledge spaces  
- **Market mechanisms**: Economic coordination models

## Implementation Examples

### Actor Model Implementations
- **[[erlang|Erlang/OTP]]**: Lightweight processes with fault tolerance
- **Akka (JVM)**: Actor framework with clustering
- **Orleans**: Virtual actors with grain abstraction
- **CAF (C++)**: High-performance actor framework

### Agent Model Implementations
- **JADE**: Java Agent DEvelopment framework
- **Mesa**: Agent-based modeling in Python
- **NetLogo**: Multi-agent programmable modeling environment
- **Holochain**: Agent-centric distributed computing platform

### Hybrid Implementations

#### Holochain: Agent-Centric + Actor Patterns
Holochain uniquely combines both models:
- **Agent identity**: Each participant is an autonomous agent
- **Actor-like communication**: Message passing between agents
- **Distributed hash table**: Shared data layer
- **Validation rules**: Social DNA governing agent behavior

## Use Case Alignment

### Actor Model Best For:
- **High-throughput systems**: Financial trading, telecommunications
- **Fault-tolerant services**: 24/7 availability requirements  
- **Real-time processing**: Gaming, chat systems, streaming
- **Microservices**: Loosely coupled distributed services
- **Event-driven architectures**: Reactive systems

### Agent Model Best For:
- **Complex decision making**: Supply chain optimization, smart grids
- **Multi-party negotiation**: Resource allocation, auction systems
- **Adaptive systems**: Recommendation engines, personalization
- **Simulation and modeling**: Economic models, social dynamics
- **IoT and edge computing**: Autonomous device coordination

## Architecture Patterns

### Actor-Based Architecture
```
[Load Balancer] → [Actor Pool] → [Message Router] → [Worker Actors]
                      ↓
[Supervisor Tree] → [Error Recovery] → [System Monitoring]
```
- **Stateless workers**: Easily replaceable and scalable
- **Message queues**: Buffer and route communications  
- **Supervision**: Hierarchical error handling
- **Horizontal scaling**: Add more actor instances

### Agent-Based Architecture  
```
[Agent Directory] ↔ [Negotiation Layer] ↔ [Knowledge Base]
        ↕                    ↕                    ↕
[Agent Registry] ↔ [Communication Bus] ↔ [Learning Engine]
        ↕                    ↕                    ↕  
[Environment] ← [Agent Instances] → [Goal Manager]
```
- **Agent discovery**: Registry and directory services
- **Knowledge management**: Shared ontologies and beliefs
- **Learning systems**: Adaptation and improvement
- **Goal coordination**: Multi-agent planning

## Performance and Scalability

### Actor Model Performance
- **Extremely high concurrency**: Millions of lightweight actors
- **Low latency**: Direct message passing
- **Linear scalability**: Add machines to handle more actors
- **Memory efficient**: Minimal overhead per actor
- **Predictable performance**: Deterministic message handling

### Agent Model Performance

```
Use actors to manage the lifecycle and coordination of intelligent agents.

### Agents Controlling Actor Systems

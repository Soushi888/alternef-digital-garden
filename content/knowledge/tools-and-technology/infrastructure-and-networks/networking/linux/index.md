# Linux Operating System

Linux is the cornerstone of modern network infrastructure and cloud computing. As a Unix-like, open-source operating system created by Linus Torvalds in 1991, Linux has become the dominant platform for servers, networking equipment, and embedded systems worldwide. Its robust networking capabilities, security features, and flexibility make it the preferred choice for infrastructure and network management.

# Operating Systems

This section explores the fundamental architectures and principles of operating systems that form the foundation of modern computing infrastructure. From traditional monolithic kernels to cutting-edge unikernels, we examine how different design choices impact performance, security, and reliability.

## Core Topics

### [[kernel-architectures|Kernel Architectures]]
Comprehensive comparison of monolithic kernels, microkernels, and unikernels, examining their design philosophies, trade-offs, and real-world applications.

### [[knowledge/tools-and-technology/infrastructure-and-networks/networking/linux/linux|Linux Systems]]
Deep dive into the world's most successful open-source operating system, its distributions, and ecosystem.

## Key Concepts

### System Architecture
- **Kernel Design**: How the core OS component manages system resources
- **Process Management**: Scheduling, execution contexts, and inter-process communication
- **Memory Management**: Virtual memory, paging, and memory protection
- **File Systems**: Data organization, storage management, and I/O operations

### System Types

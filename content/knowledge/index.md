## Interconnected Knowledge Ecosystem

Welcome to the Alternef Digital Garden's Knowledge Base â€“ a dynamic, interconnected repository of insights spanning multiple domains of human experience and understanding.

### Inspired by Permaculture Principles

This knowledge base is structured around the seven domains of knowledge, drawing inspiration from the holistic design principles of permaculture. Just as permaculture seeks to create sustainable and regenerative systems by understanding the interconnections between different elements, our knowledge base aims to explore the intricate relationships across diverse domains of human experience.

The seven domains represent a holistic approach to understanding our world:

- Recognizing the interconnectedness of different aspects of life
- Promoting systemic thinking
- Valuing diversity and complex interactions
- Seeking regenerative and sustainable solutions

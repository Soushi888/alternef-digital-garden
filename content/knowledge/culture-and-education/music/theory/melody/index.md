Melody is the dimension of music that organizes sound **sequentially** — the horizontal line that the ear follows through time. It is the most immediately recognizable element of music: what we hum, what we remember, what carries the singer's voice or the soloist's story. A melody implies both rhythm (its temporal shape) and harmony (the chords it suggests), making it the thread that weaves the other dimensions together.

Music theory explores the principles that organize sound into meaningful expression. From the Pythagorean ratios of the [[quadrivium|Quadrivium]] to contemporary jazz and tango harmony, theory reveals the mathematical and perceptual structures underlying all music.

## Core Domains

Three fundamental dimensions define the space of musical possibility:

- [[knowledge/culture-and-education/music/theory/rhythm/index|Rhythm]] — Music in *time*: pulse, meter, syncopation, polyrhythm, groove
- [[knowledge/culture-and-education/music/theory/harmony/index|Harmony]] — Music in *vertical space*: intervals, chords, tonality, modes, voice leading
- [[knowledge/culture-and-education/music/theory/melody/index|Melody]] — Music in *horizontal space*: contour, phrasing, scales, ornamentation, motif development

These three dimensions are interdependent: a melody implies harmony, harmony unfolds in rhythm, and rhythmic patterns shape melodic phrasing. Mastery lies in understanding each domain on its own terms and in their interaction.

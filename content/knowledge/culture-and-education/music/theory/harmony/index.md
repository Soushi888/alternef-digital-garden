Harmony is the dimension of music that organizes **simultaneous sounds** — what happens when tones sound together. It governs the tension and resolution, the color and mood that give music its emotional depth. From Pythagorean consonance to [[nuevo-tango|Piazzolla's]] jazz-inflected dissonances, harmony is the vertical architecture of musical expression.

Music occupies a unique place at the intersection of mathematical structure and human emotion. In the classical [[quadrivium|Quadrivium]], it was understood as "number in time" — the study of temporal proportion and harmony unfolding through sound. Beyond theory, music is a living practice of cultural transmission, collective improvisation, and embodied knowledge.

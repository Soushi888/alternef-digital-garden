# Permaculture

Permaculture is a holistic design philosophy and practice that aims to create sustainable, self-sufficient systems by mimicking the patterns and relationships found in natural ecosystems. Originally defined as "permanent agriculture" by Australian biologists Bill Mollison and David Holmgren in their 1978 book *Permaculture One*, the concept has evolved to encompass "permanent culture," integrating ecological, social, and ethical dimensions. It emphasizes working with nature rather than against it, promoting thoughtful observation, and designing systems that are diverse, stable, and resilient.

## Core Ethics

The foundation of permaculture rests on three core ethics:

1. **Earth Care**: Taking care of the living systems that support life on Earth
2. **People Care**: Taking care of people and ensuring their needs are met
3. **Fair Share**: Sharing resources equitably and living within ecological limits

## Design Principles

Permaculture operates on twelve design principles that guide decision-making:

1. **Observe and Interact**: Careful observation leads to thoughtful design
2. **Catch and Store Energy**: Harvest and conserve resources when abundant
3. **Obtain a Yield**: Ensure systems produce useful outcomes
4. **Apply Self-Regulation**: Use feedback to maintain system balance
5. **Use Renewable Resources**: Favor renewable over non-renewable inputs
6. **Produce No Waste**: Value and utilize all resources efficiently
7. **Design from Patterns to Details**: Work from the big picture to specifics
8. **Integrate Rather than Segregate**: Create beneficial relationships between elements
9. **Use Small and Slow Solutions**: Build systems that are manageable and adaptive
10. **Use and Value Diversity**: Diversity creates stability and resilience
11. **Use Edges and Value the Marginal**: Interface areas are often most productive
12. **Creatively Use and Respond to Change**: Adapt positively to changing circumstances

## Applications and Practices

### Agricultural Applications
- **No-till gardening**: Maintaining soil structure and biology
- **Composting**: Recycling organic matter into soil nutrition
- **Companion planting**: Growing mutually beneficial plant combinations
- **Agroforestry**: Integrating trees with crops and livestock
- **Water harvesting**: Capturing and storing rainwater for irrigation

### Beyond Agriculture
Permaculture extends far beyond farming to include:

- **Sustainable architecture**: Buildings that work with natural systems
- **Community design**: Creating resilient social structures
- **Ecovillages**: Intentional communities with low environmental impact
- **Urban applications**: Adapting principles to city environments
- **Economic systems**: Designing regenerative economic models

## Global Movement

While rooted in sustainable land management, permaculture has grown into a global movement with over three million practitioners in 140 countries as of the early 21st century. The movement includes:

- **Permaculture Design Courses (PDC)**: Standardized 72-hour training programs
- **Demonstration sites**: Working examples of permaculture principles
- **Research centers**: Academic institutions studying permaculture systems
- **Publications and media**: Books, journals, and online resources
- **Certification programs**: Training for permaculture teachers and consultants

## Challenges and Criticisms

Despite its widespread adoption, permaculture faces several challenges:

### Economic Limitations
- **Labor intensity**: Many permaculture practices require significant manual work
- **Lower yields**: Potentially reduced production compared to industrial agriculture
- **Market constraints**: Limited demand for diverse, small-scale production

### Practical Challenges
- **Urban limitations**: Space, regulations, and startup costs in cities
- **Technical complexity**: Systems like biogas digesters or aquaculture require expertise
- **Scale questions**: Uncertainty about feeding global populations
- **Knowledge transfer**: Difficulty scaling traditional knowledge systems

### Scientific Scrutiny
- **Research gaps**: Limited peer-reviewed studies on specific claims
- **Measurement challenges**: Difficulty quantifying some benefits
- **Variable outcomes**: Results depend heavily on local conditions and implementation

## Relationship to Other Approaches

Permaculture shares principles and practices with several related movements:

- **[[regenerative-agriculture|Regenerative Agriculture]]**: Focus on soil health and ecosystem restoration
- **Agroecology**: Scientific study of ecological processes in agricultural systems
- **Biodynamic farming**: Holistic approach emphasizing farm as living organism
- **Indigenous practices**: Traditional ecological knowledge and land stewardship

## Modern Applications and Innovation

Contemporary permaculture continues to evolve with new applications:

- **[[knowledge/tools-and-technology/web-and-internet-technologies/decentralized-web/digital-permaculture|Digital Permaculture]]**: Applying principles to technology and digital systems
- **[[bioregional-stewardship|Bioregional permaculture]]**: Watershed-scale design and bioregional organization
- **Climate adaptation**: Designing for changing environmental conditions
- **Social permaculture**: Focusing on human relationships and social systems
- **Urban permaculture**: Adapting principles for city environments

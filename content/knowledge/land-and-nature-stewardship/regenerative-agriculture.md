# Regenerative Agriculture

Regenerative agriculture is an innovative, holistic farming system designed to restore and enhance the health of ecosystems, particularly soil, while improving productivity and resilience. It aims to reverse environmental degradation by focusing on rebuilding soil organic matter, increasing biodiversity, and creating more resilient agroecosystems. This approach goes beyond sustainable practices by actively regenerating degraded land rather than merely maintaining its current state.

## Core Principles

The fundamental principles of regenerative agriculture include:

- **Minimizing soil disturbance** through reduced or no-till practices
- **Maintaining permanent soil cover** to prevent erosion and support microbial life
- **Increasing plant diversity** through crop rotation and polycultures
- **Integrating livestock grazing** that mimics natural ecosystem patterns
- **Avoiding synthetic inputs** such as fertilizers, pesticides, and heavy machinery

These practices work together to improve water retention, enhance nutrient cycling, and create more resilient agroecosystems capable of withstanding extreme weather events like droughts and floods. When viewed through a [[bioregional-stewardship|bioregional lens]], these practices also support watershed health, biodiversity conservation, and community resilience beyond the farm boundary.

## Historical Context

The concept was first defined in the early 1980s by the Rodale Institute, a US non-profit organization, which positioned it as a step beyond organic agriculture by emphasizing the active restoration of soil health and ecosystem function. While the term "regenerative agriculture" is widely used in English, the French equivalent "agriculture régénératrice" is considered more academically precise, though the English term has become dominant in global discourse.

## Practices and Methods

### Soil Management
- **Cover cropping**: Keeping soil covered year-round with living plants
- **Composting**: Building soil organic matter through decomposed organic materials
- **Reduced tillage**: Minimizing mechanical soil disturbance

### Biodiversity Enhancement
- **Crop rotation**: Alternating different crops to break pest cycles and improve soil
- **Companion planting**: Growing complementary plants together
- **Wildlife corridors**: Creating habitat for beneficial insects and animals

### Livestock Integration
- **Rotational grazing**: Moving livestock to prevent overgrazing
- **Holistic management**: Integrating animals as ecosystem partners
- **Silvopasture**: Combining trees, forage, and livestock

## Benefits and Claims

Regenerative agriculture is increasingly promoted for addressing various challenges:

- **Food sovereignty**: Reducing dependency on large agrochemical companies
- **Rural community support**: Enhancing long-term farm profitability through improved yields and reduced input costs
- **Biodiversity conservation**: Creating habitat and supporting ecosystem services
- **Water quality improvement**: Reducing agricultural runoff and contamination

## Global Examples and Organizations

Several organizations and projects are advancing the practice globally:

- **Rodale Institute**: Pioneer research organization in Pennsylvania, USA
- **Polyfarming project** in Catalonia, Spain: Demonstrating potential for reversing land degradation and combating rural abandonment
- **Syngenta Group**: Corporate integration with digital technologies and artificial intelligence
- **Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)**: Supporting regenerative agriculture as a system that improves water and air quality and enhances biodiversity

## Challenges and Limitations

Despite its growing popularity, regenerative agriculture faces several challenges:

- **Certification standardization**: The field lacks universally standardized certification, though initiatives like the Regenerative Organic Certification in the United States exist
- **Economic transition**: Initial costs and learning curves for farmers switching practices
- **Scale limitations**: Questions about feeding global populations with current yields
- **Research gaps**: Need for more long-term studies on specific practices and outcomes

# Hyper-Localism

Hyper-localism is a political, social, and economic philosophy that emphasizes **extreme decentralization**, prioritizing decision-making and resource control at the **smallest possible community level** — often neighborhoods, villages, small towns, or even individual blocks. Unlike more moderate decentralization approaches, hyper-localism advocates for governance and production at the most granular level feasible, often skeptical of or hostile toward higher levels of government coordination.

## Core Principles

### Extreme Scale Reduction
- **Neighborhood Focus**: Primary decision-making at the neighborhood, block, or village level
- **Household Autonomy**: Maximum sovereignty for individual households and immediate communities
- **Micro-Governance**: Governance structures limited to the smallest practical geographic units
- **Direct Participation**: Emphasis on face-to-face democracy and direct citizen engagement

### Economic Self-Reliance
- **Local Production**: Food, energy, and goods produced at neighborhood or household scale
- **Community Currencies**: Local monetary systems independent of national currencies
- **Skill Sharing**: Exchange of services and knowledge within immediate geographic areas
- **Circular Economies**: Closed-loop resource systems at community level

### Political Independence
- **Minimal Higher Authority**: Skepticism or rejection of regional, national, and supranational governance
- **Consensus Decision-Making**: Preference for unanimous agreement over majority voting
- **Rotating Leadership**: Non-hierarchical organizational structures with shared responsibility
- **Parallel Institutions**: Creation of alternative community structures outside state systems

### Ecological Integration
- **Bioregional Alignment**: Community organization aligned with natural boundaries and ecosystems
- **Sustainable Scale**: Human activities scaled to local ecological carrying capacity
- **Traditional Knowledge**: Integration of indigenous and place-based wisdom
- **Low-Tech Solutions**: Preference for appropriate technology over industrial systems

## Historical Context and Philosophical Roots

### Anarchist Traditions
- **Murray Bookchin's Libertarian Municipalism**: Confederation of autonomous municipalities
- **Peter Kropotkin's Mutual Aid**: Cooperation as natural evolutionary strategy

## Comparison with Subsidiarity

### Fundamental Differences

| Aspect | Hyper-Localism | Subsidiarity |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| **Scale Preference** | As small as possible (neighborhood, village, household) | Lowest level that is **competent** to handle the task |
| **Attitude to Higher Authority** | Often skeptical or hostile; seeks to minimize or abolish | Accepts higher authority when necessary for common good |
| **Philosophical Basis** | Anarchism, libertarian municipalism, deep ecology | Catholic social teaching, federalism, conservative thought |
| **Decision Criterion** | Ideological (smaller is always better) | Pragmatic (can this level actually do it well?) |
| **View of Hierarchy** | Rejects or radically flattens hierarchical structures | Accepts ordered hierarchy with strong downward presumption |
| **Relationship to State** | Often seeks autonomy from or replacement of state institutions | Works within and seeks to improve state institutions |

### Complementary Relationships

**Shared Values**:
- **Local Autonomy**: Both prioritize decision-making at appropriate local levels
- **Community Empowerment**: Emphasis on building local capacity and self-reliance
- **Human Scale**: Preference for governance structures that people can directly influence
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Respect for local traditions, knowledge, and conditions

**Practical Overlaps**:
- **Devolution Support**: Both approaches support decentralization reforms
- **Local Innovation**: Encourage experimentation and diverse approaches at community level
- **Citizen Participation**: Promote direct engagement in governance processes
- **Place-Based Solutions**: Tailor responses to local conditions and needs

### Tensions and Conflicts

**Scale Disagreements**:
- **Minimum vs. Optimal**: Hyper-localism pushes for smallest possible units, subsidiarity seeks most effective scale
- **Ideological vs. Pragmatic**: Hyper-localism is principled about smallness, subsidiarity is outcome-oriented
- **Uniform vs. Variable**: Hyper-localism often seeks consistent decentralization, subsidiarity accepts variable scales

**Implementation Challenges**:
- **Coordination Problems**: Multiple hyper-local units may struggle with regional coordination
- **Resource Inequalities**: Smaller units may lack capacity for complex tasks
- **Externalities**: Issues that cross community boundaries may be neglected
- **Standards and Rights**: Protection of fundamental rights across diverse local approaches

## Contemporary Applications

- **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)**: Blockchain-based community governance
- **Platform Cooperativism**: Worker-owned digital platforms serving local communities
- **Mesh Networks**: Community-owned internet infrastructure

### Social Dynamics
- **Local Majorities**: Risk of local majoritarianism overriding individual rights
- **Exclusion**: "Local" communities may exclude newcomers or minorities

*An exploration of the harmonious union of breath, body, and mind through ancient and modern traditions*

## Overview

Hatha yoga represents one of the oldest and most complete paths for harmonizing the human being. This millennia-old practice, enriched by the Egyptian traditions of the "Yoga of the Pharaohs" and the contemporary approach of the "Yoga of Verticality," offers a unique synthesis between ancestral wisdom and modern applications.

The term "hatha" combines the Sanskrit words "ha" (sun) and "tha" (moon), symbolizing the balance of opposing and complementary forces that govern human existence.

## The Foundations of Hatha Yoga

### Philosophy and Objectives

Hatha yoga integrates a holistic vision comprising:

- **Personal ethics**: Principles of harmonious conduct
- **Purification**: Physical and energetic cleansing techniques
- **Postures (asanas)**: Positions for structural balance
- **Breathing (pranayama)**: Control of breath and vital energy
- **Meditation**: Development of awareness and attention

### The Six Limbs of Hatha Yoga

Unlike the eight limbs of classical raja yoga, hatha yoga is structured into six stages (shatanga yoga):

1. **Shatkarma**: Six purification actions
2. **Asana**: Physical postures
3. **Pranayama**: Breathing techniques
4. **Mudra**: Internalized energetic gestures
5. **Dhyana**: Meditation
6. **Samadhi**: Contemplative absorption

## The Yoga of the Pharaohs (Kemetic Yoga)

### Origins and Historical Foundations

The "Yoga of the Pharaohs" or Kemetic Yoga draws its roots from ancient Egypt, where this practice was known as **"Smi Tawi"** (Union of the Two Lands), symbolizing the unification of the higher and lower nature of the human being.

#### Historical Context

- **Historical research**: Study of authentic Egyptian sources

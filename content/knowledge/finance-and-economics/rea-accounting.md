# REA Accounting

REA (Resource-Event-Agent) accounting is a conceptual framework for modeling and tracking economic activities, originally developed by accounting professor William E. McCarthy in 1982. Unlike traditional double-entry bookkeeping, which focuses on recording financial transactions in terms of debits and credits within a ledger, REA takes a more holistic and process-oriented approach. It emphasizes the real-world entities and activities involved in economic exchanges—resources, events, and agents—making it a versatile model for both conventional and alternative economic systems.

## Core Components

REA breaks down economic activity into three fundamental elements:

1. **Resources**: Things of economic value that are produced, consumed, or exchanged. These can be tangible (e.g., goods like a car or wheat) or intangible (e.g., services, intellectual property, or time).

2. **Events**: Economic actions or occurrences that affect resources. Examples include producing something, transferring ownership, consuming a resource, or providing a service. Events are the "what happened" of an economic process.

3. **Agents**: The individuals, organizations, or entities that participate in these events. Agents are typically divided into "internal" (e.g., a company employee) and "external" (e.g., a customer or supplier) roles, showing who gives or receives resources.

## How REA Works

REA models economic activity as a sequence of exchanges or transformations, focusing on the flow of resources between agents. It identifies two main types of events:

- **Increment Events**: Increase the quantity or value of a resource (e.g., producing goods or receiving payment).
- **Decrement Events**: Decrease the quantity or value of a resource (e.g., selling goods or paying for supplies).

These events are linked by a **duality relationship**, meaning that every "give" event (decrement) is paired with a "take" event (increment). For example:

- A sale involves a company giving a product (decrement) and receiving cash (increment) from a customer.
- The customer, in turn, gives cash (decrement) and receives the product (increment).

This duality ensures that the model captures the full cycle of economic reciprocity without needing artificial constructs like accounts payable or receivable, which are common in traditional accounting.

## Structure and Process

REA organizes economic activity into a pattern:

1. **Resources are tracked**: What's being exchanged or transformed?
2. **Events are recorded**: What actions occurred, when, and in what quantities?
3. **Agents are identified**: Who was involved on each side of the event?

For instance:
- A bakery produces 100 loaves of bread (event: production; resource: bread; agent: baker).
- The bakery sells 80 loaves to a store (event: transfer; resource: bread decreases, cash increases; agents: bakery and store).

This structure can be extended to include planning (e.g., commitments to future events) and additional details (e.g., locations, timestamps, or conditions).

## Key Differences from Traditional Accounting

- **Focus on Reality**: Traditional double-entry bookkeeping abstracts economic activity into financial terms (debits and credits), often losing sight of the underlying resources and events. REA models the actual "stuff" and "actions" directly.

- **No Accounts**: REA doesn't rely on ledgers with predefined accounts (e.g., "cash" or "inventory"). Instead, it tracks resources dynamically as they flow through events.

- **Flexibility**: It can handle non-monetary exchanges (e.g., barter or gift economies) and non-financial value (e.g., environmental impact or social contributions), which traditional systems struggle to capture.

- **Process-Centric**: REA is designed to reflect business processes, making it a natural fit for enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems and modern software.

## Advantages

- **Clarity**: By focusing on resources and events, REA provides a clearer picture of what's actually happening in an economic system.

- **Scalability**: It's adaptable to complex networks, from small businesses to global supply chains.

- **Technology-Friendly**: REA's structure aligns well with databases and distributed systems, making it ideal for digital implementations like [[hrea|Holochain's hREA]] or [[valueflows|Valueflows]].

- **Holistic Insight**: It can track more than just money, enabling triple-bottom-line accounting (financial, social, environmental).

## Applications

- **Business Accounting**: Companies use REA to model their operations (e.g., manufacturing, sales, procurement) in ERP systems, improving efficiency and transparency.

- **Decentralized Systems**: Frameworks like [[valueflows|Valueflows]] and [[hrea|hREA]] adapt REA for peer-to-peer economic networks, such as cooperatives or blockchain-based platforms.

- **Alternative Economies**: REA supports tracking value in non-traditional systems, like sharing communities or commons-based projects, where money isn't the sole metric.

## Example

Imagine a farmer and a baker:

1. The farmer grows wheat (resource) in a production event.
2. The farmer transfers wheat to the baker (event: transfer; resource: wheat decreases for farmer, increases for baker).
3. The baker pays the farmer (event: transfer; resource: cash decreases for baker, increases for farmer).
4. The baker bakes bread (event: production; resource: wheat decreases, bread increases).
5. The baker sells bread to a customer (event: transfer; resource: bread decreases, cash increases).

REA tracks each step as a series of resource flows between agents, without needing a traditional ledger.

## Why It Matters

REA was ahead of its time, anticipating the needs of digital and networked economies. It provides a foundation for systems that need to operate beyond the limitations of centralized financial accounting—think distributed ledgers, sustainability tracking, or community resource management. By focusing on the "what," "how," and "who" of economic activity, REA offers a robust, future-proof way to understand and coordinate value creation.
